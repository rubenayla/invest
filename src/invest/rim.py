"""
Residual Income Model (RIM) - Excellent for financial companies and mature businesses.

The Residual Income Model values companies based on their ability to generate returns
above their cost of equity capital. This model is particularly effective for:
- Financial companies (banks, insurance) where DCF is problematic
- Mature companies with stable ROE
- Companies with significant book value assets

RIM Formula:
Value = Current Book Value + Present Value of Future Residual Income

Where Residual Income = (ROE - Cost of Equity) × Book Value

This model is based on the insight that a company's value comes from its ability
to earn returns above what investors require, applied to the capital employed.
