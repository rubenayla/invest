# Systematic Analysis Pipeline

## Overview

The analysis pipeline provides a systematic, multi-stage approach to stock screening and valuation.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Universe Selection
- Sources stock tickers from predefined lists (e.g., S&P 500)
- Applies initial universe-level filters:
  - Market capitalization range
  - Sector selection/exclusion

### 2. Screening Process
Each stock undergoes comprehensive screening:

#### Quality Assessment
- Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)
- Return on Equity (ROE)
- Debt levels
- Liquidity ratios

#### Value Analysis
- Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio
- Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio
- Enterprise Value to EBITDA
- Dividend yield

#### Growth Evaluation
- Revenue growth rate
- Earnings growth rate
- Sustainability of growth

#### Risk Assessment
- Financial risk metrics
- Market volatility
- Business model stability

### 3. Valuation Models
- Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
- Residual Income Model (RIM) [Planned]

## Scoring Methodology

- Each screening dimension receives a score
- Scores are weighted to create a composite score
- Weights can be customized via configuration

### Composite Score Calculation
- Quality: 30%
- Value: 30%
- Growth: 25%
- Risk: 15% (inverted)

## Configuration

Pipeline behavior is defined in YAML configuration files:
- `configs/` directory contains predefined configurations
- Allows customizing:
  - Screening thresholds
  - Valuation models
  - Sector-specific adjustments

## Implementation Details

- Located in `pipeline.py`
- Implements `AnalysisPipeline` class
- Modular design for easy extension

## Performance Optimization

- Market cap pre-filtering
- Efficient data fetching
- Configurable universe size
