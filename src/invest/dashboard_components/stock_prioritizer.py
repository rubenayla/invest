StockPrioritizer - Handles stock analysis prioritization logic.

- Determining which stocks should be analyzed first
- Prioritizing based on data freshness, completeness, and previous failures
- Providing intelligent ordering to optimize dashboard updates
- Avoiding rate limits by spacing out API-heavy operations
