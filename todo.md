now compare your previous analysis to the one of the repo, and try to understand why your recommendations differ. What is different?

- Create parameter that includes the 5 year past earning growth as in the video, and use it in filter. It certainly matches with high PE companies, might wanna do it for small caps that combine that with low PE. Might want to do the analysis of the video taking the second derivative of the earnings too, see if there's correlation too

# Analyze stocks like Berkshire correctly
  Given the current system's capabilities, here are more feasible ways to improve the analysis for such businesses:

   * Focus on Book Value Growth: For companies like Berkshire Hathaway, growth in book value per share is often a more meaningful metric
     than traditional revenue or earnings growth. It directly reflects the compounding of their underlying assets. We could incorporate
     this as a key growth metric in the screening process.
   * Adjusting Thresholds/Weights: For identified holding companies, we could apply different, more lenient growth thresholds, or give
     less weight to traditional growth metrics and more weight to balance sheet strength (e.g., high current ratio, low debt-to-equity)
     and overall return on assets/equity, which reflect efficient capital deployment.
   * Custom Configuration: We could create a specific configuration file tailored for holding companies, with adjusted metrics and
     thresholds.

  In summary, while a full automated Sum-of-the-Parts valuation is complex, we can make significant improvements by:
   1. Developing methods to identify these "special kinds" of businesses.
   2. Incorporating more relevant metrics like book value growth.
   3. Adjusting the weighting or thresholds of existing metrics to better reflect their unique financial characteristics.

## Advanced Valuation Models to Implement
- [x] **Residual Income Model (RIM)** ⭐⭐⭐ - Perfect for financial companies
    - RIM = Book Value + PV(Abnormal Earnings)
    - Abnormal Earnings = (ROE - Cost of Equity) × Book Value
    - Great for banks, insurance companies where DCF struggles
- [x] **Monte Carlo DCF** ⭐⭐ - Add confidence intervals
    - Use probability distributions for growth rates, discount rates
    - Output: "Fair Value: $45.67 (Range: $38.12 - $52.34, 68% confidence)"
- [x] **Multi-Stage DCF** ⭐⭐⭐ - More realistic growth phases
    - Phase 1: High growth (Years 1-5)
    - Phase 2: Transition (Years 6-10)
    - Phase 3: Terminal stable growth
- [x] **Sector-Specific Models** ⭐⭐ - COMPLETED! ✅
    - REITs: FFO (Funds From Operations) based ✅
    - Banks: ROE/Book value, regulatory capital ratios ✅
    - Tech: Revenue multiples, PEG growth metrics ✅  
    - Utilities: Dividend discount, regulatory frameworks ✅
- [x] **Ensemble/Blended Model** ⭐⭐⭐ - COMPLETED! ✅
    - Intelligent weighted average of all suitable models ✅
    - Automatically adjust weights based on sector, confidence, and data quality ✅
    - Comprehensive consensus metrics and uncertainty quantification ✅
- [ ] **Real Options Valuation** ⭐ - For high-growth tech companies
    - Value growth opportunities as call options
    - Especially good for companies with significant R&D or expansion potential

- Gross profit margin =  > .1
- Revenue grows 
- Gross profit grows 
- Shares outstanding 
- Equity
- Equity per share = $/share
- Time to pay debt: Long term liabilities / free cash flow =  /  =  < 5
