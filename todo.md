There are lots of untracked files that should either be committed or ignored. Take a look please.


- Consider gold, bitcoin, etc. as alternatives to stocks, instructions for AI to consider waiting, like berkshire has sometimes done, to wait for better opportunities with treasuries, short-term bonds, etc.

- dashboard with the top companies and critical data
- I'm thinking it would be cool to add some performance indicators, run the automatic analysis since x date until today and see what returns it gets. However, where can we get data old enough to do this? My idea is to have a pool of stocks to choose from, and the analysis would be run, deciding what to invest in. Then we simulate the profits, and whatever configuration achieves the highest profit wins.



# Analyze stocks like Berkshire correctly
  Given the current system's capabilities, here are more feasible ways to improve the analysis for such businesses:

   * Focus on Book Value Growth: For companies like Berkshire Hathaway, growth in book value per share is often a more meaningful metric
     than traditional revenue or earnings growth. It directly reflects the compounding of their underlying assets. We could incorporate
     this as a key growth metric in the screening process.
   * Adjusting Thresholds/Weights: For identified holding companies, we could apply different, more lenient growth thresholds, or give
     less weight to traditional growth metrics and more weight to balance sheet strength (e.g., high current ratio, low debt-to-equity)
     and overall return on assets/equity, which reflect efficient capital deployment.
   * Custom Configuration: We could create a specific configuration file tailored for holding companies, with adjusted metrics and
     thresholds.

  In summary, while a full automated Sum-of-the-Parts valuation is complex, we can make significant improvements by:
   1. Developing methods to identify these "special kinds" of businesses.
   2. Incorporating more relevant metrics like book value growth.
   3. Adjusting the weighting or thresholds of existing metrics to better reflect their unique financial characteristics.
