For testing, add an agent (how are they called? the ones that choose what to invest in. It's not the same as the valuation model, since it must choose one or several stocks to invest in, not just value them independently) that simply buys the biggest stocks of the sp500. If forced to diversity, the top x stocks, otherwise the top stock. Just that. I'd like it for comparison purposes and to see how it performs. Some curiosity.

Make sure the actions either work or are deleted

- Let's update the code to be able to value ETFs, and do the backtest with those. Should we make the code able to handle anything, or separate ETFs and stocks, so each one is separate and easier to understand/manage?
- Consider gold, bitcoin, etc. as alternatives to stocks, instructions for AI to consider waiting, like berkshire has sometimes done, to wait for better opportunities with treasuries, short-term bonds, etc.

# Analyze stocks like Berkshire correctly
  Given the current system's capabilities, here are more feasible ways to improve the analysis for such businesses:

   * Focus on Book Value Growth: For companies like Berkshire Hathaway, growth in book value per share is often a more meaningful metric
     than traditional revenue or earnings growth. It directly reflects the compounding of their underlying assets. We could incorporate
     this as a key growth metric in the screening process.
   * Adjusting Thresholds/Weights: For identified holding companies, we could apply different, more lenient growth thresholds, or give
     less weight to traditional growth metrics and more weight to balance sheet strength (e.g., high current ratio, low debt-to-equity)
     and overall return on assets/equity, which reflect efficient capital deployment.
   * Custom Configuration: We could create a specific configuration file tailored for holding companies, with adjusted metrics and
     thresholds.

  In summary, while a full automated Sum-of-the-Parts valuation is complex, we can make significant improvements by:
   1. Developing methods to identify these "special kinds" of businesses.
   2. Incorporating more relevant metrics like book value growth.
   3. Adjusting the weighting or thresholds of existing metrics to better reflect their unique financial characteristics.



# Check
- IBKR Market screener 2.0
- Update checklists to use check operating margin instead of gross?

- Study LOGI in more depth. Great fundamentals. I would pay twice its stock value
- Study skyworks in more depth
- Study steel dynamics. What's going to happen with steel demand? If it falls back down after all these investments, the stock will collapse.
