Do we still have the code that analyzes stocks and configures a threshold to report about 1 investing recommendation per week, programmed to run daily at about 5AM... all that? I told clawd to do that in the previous server, before moving to Hetzner. I want to set it up again.

# improve SYF analysis, include risks
Valuation – Cheap Relative to History and Peers

Trailing P/E: ~8x — very low compared with the broader market and its industry.

Forward P/E also ~8–9x, suggesting the cheap valuation isn’t just a one-time slump.

Price/Book ~1.68x, not excessive for a bank/finance stock.

Historical median P/E for SYF is ~7.9x, so current valuation is around historical norms, not a freak low.

Most valuation screens see it as undervalued on multiples, especially vs consumer financial peers.

What’s Driving the Cheap Valuation

Credit performance risk: charge-offs and credit costs have been elevated compared to history, which pressures earnings.

Consumer finance stocks often trade at low multiples when expectations for loan growth or net interest margins are weak.

Dividend

Yield ~1.2–1.6% — small, not a big income stock.

What That Means for Your $1k

If you buy ~1,000 USD worth at ~75 USD/share:

~13 shares (13 × 75 ≈ 975 USD)


(You can adjust for fractional shares if your broker allows.)

Risk / Why It Might Be Cheap

Financials are sensitive to credit cycles, interest rates, and economic growth (worse credit quality hurts earnings).

Earnings growth forecasts aren’t robust — this is value pricing, not growth pricing.

Summary (no fluff)

Valuation: clearly inexpensive by P/E and historically cheap relative to peers.

Dividend: small, not a primary reason to own.

Risks: tied to credit quality and future net interest income trends.

If you’re value-focused and comfortable with a financials cyclical business, SYF is cheap on valuation metrics right now, not expensive.

isn't it low for a reason? like interest rates or competition

Yes. SYF is cheap for specific, real reasons—not a mystery discount.

Why Synchrony Financial trades at a low multiple

Credit-cycle risk (the big one)

SYF is exposed to subprime / near-prime consumer credit (store cards, private-label).

Charge-offs and delinquencies rise when consumers are stressed. Markets discount this before it peaks.

Even if rates fall later, losses hit earnings now.

Interest rates cut both ways

High rates helped net interest income initially.

But they also hurt borrowers, increasing defaults.

The market is pricing the late-cycle downside, not the headline NIM.

Retail partner concentration & competition

SYF depends on large retail partners (Walmart in the past, Amazon, etc.).

Partners can renegotiate, switch banks, or push margins down.

Competition from big banks + BNPL pressures pricing and growth.

Regulatory + capital sensitivity

Consumer finance attracts regulatory scrutiny.

Capital requirements + provisioning volatility justify lower P/E than non-financials.

This is normal for consumer lenders

A ~7–9× P/E is typical for late-cycle consumer credit businesses.

It’s not “deep value” unless you believe credit losses will normalize faster than expected.

So what’s the real bet?

Buying SYF at ~8× earnings is a bet that:

Credit losses peak and stabilize,

Earnings don’t structurally collapse, and

Capital returns (buybacks/dividends) continue.

Bottom line (no fluff)

Yes, it’s low for a reason.

That reason is credit risk + cycle timing, not fraud or terminal decline.

If you’re early in the cycle → risky.

If you’re patient and accept volatility → valuation is defensible.

If you want, I can compare SYF vs other consumer lenders (COF, DFS, AXP) and tell you which one is best positioned for a downturn.

Charge-offs

this is not paying the debt? the credit card debt?

Correct. “Charge-offs” = customers not paying their credit-card debt.

Precisely:

A charge-off happens when a borrower is so delinquent (≈180 days past due) that the bank concludes the debt is unlikely to be collected.

The bank writes the loan off as a loss on the income statement.

This directly reduces earnings.

For Synchrony Financial specifically:

SYF specializes in store cards / private-label credit, which skew lower-credit-quality than prime bank cards.

When consumers are stressed (inflation, high rates, job risk), missed payments rise first, then charge-offs rise later.

The market prices SYF cheaply because it expects higher charge-offs than normal.

Important nuance (where people get confused):

The debt is not “forgiven” immediately — collections may still recover some money later.

But accounting rules require SYF to recognize the loss upfront.

So even if recoveries happen later, today’s profits still take the hit.

Why this matters for valuation

Higher charge-offs → lower net income → lower P/E justified.

SYF at ~8× earnings implies the market expects credit losses to stay elevated.

One-line takeaway

Yes — the risk isn’t competition or rates alone.
It’s that a meaningful slice of cardholders may simply stop paying, and SYF eats that loss.

If you want, I can show you charge-off trends vs peers (COF, DFS, AXP) so you can see whether SYF is unusually risky or just normal for this cycle.

yes please

Here’s a fact-based comparison of credit-card charge-off/delinquency trends for SYF vs other big U.S. issuers — so you see why SYF’s risks are higher:

1) SYF charge-offs are higher than many peers

Synchrony Financial saw net charge-offs around 6.3–6.4% of its loan receivables — well above historical averages and above most broad bank averages. This was large enough to hurt earnings and trigger a stock sell-off.

2) By contrast, major general-purpose card issuers have lower charge-offs

Data from industry reports shows (not SYF-specific) average net charge-off rates for the largest U.S. credit card issuers — including American Express, Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan, Capital One, Discover — running in the ~1.8–4.7% range depending on the lender and period.

Example: Capital One’s card net charge-off rate was ~4.7%, which is significantly below SYF’s ~6%+.

American Express net write-offs reported historically ~1.9–2.2% (much lower), reflecting higher-credit borrowers.

3) Delinquency trends also differ

SYF’s 30+ day delinquency has been reported around 4.5%, higher than many general-purpose lenders because SYF’s store-card portfolios include lower-credit customers.

4) Why SYF is higher risk statistically

Store/private-label credit (SYF’s core) historically has charge-off rates nearly double those on general-purpose credit cards because:

underwriting tends to be looser,

cards are issued to lower credit tiers,

promotional terms can mask early repayment risk.

Simple comparison summary
Issuer	Typical Net Charge-Off Rate	Relative Credit Quality
SYF	~6%+	More subprime/store cards
Capital One (COF)	~4.7%	Mixed credit quality
Broader bank average	~2–4%	Mixed retail/general
American Express	~1.9–2.2%	Higher-credit consumers

(Numbers vary by report and time, but the pattern is consistent.)

Interpretation

SYF charge-offs are significantly higher than most peers — that’s a principal reason its valuation (P/E ~8×) is lower than many financials.

Higher charge-offs imply more earnings volatility if defaults rise further, so the cheap valuation isn’t arbitrary — it reflects real higher credit risk.

If you want, I can graph the issuer charge-off rates together so you can visually compare SYF vs Capital One vs AmEx vs general bank averages.


# Todo List
- Investigate other projects online to see if there's a promising one for stock analysis and valuation in medium/long term, mainly based on fundamentals. 
- [ ] Configure Grafana (Fix permissions and setup dashboards)

_(Note: Restored from previous content on 2026-01-21)_

- marubeni not in dashboard? add them if missing
- whats up with the rim model with some stocks? it provides crazy high values

- META?
- check energy companies
- analyze CEG, VSG, NEE, and ETN
- analyze AEP, EXC, VRT, HUBB
- consider Argentina ETF (ARGT): availability on IBKR/Revolut + investment decision

- I want to run some simulations of investments using each model, investing on
  old data, so we can check how much money would they have made if used in the
  past. I'm not sure if this would fail due to analyzing on already seen data
  though. Maybe skip some stocks and periods randomly from training and use them
  for testing? Or create a separate test model, just for this task?


- I basically want to take the max price of the period from next year to next 2
  years, and train with that, instead of the price just after one year. Maybe this
  should be the opportunistic model. To this model, somehow make it conservative so
  we actually check that it is super super unlikely to get stocks in the lower % of
  returns, even if some % of super high gains. (Think about probability
  distribution and how to rate it?)

- i want gbm for 1y 3y both in normal and lite version
- show them all in the dashboard


- Does the neural network predictor look good? I just cloned the repo, so we may
  need to retrain it. I'd like to understand the cases where it's very different
  from other predictions and undertsand why. We need a reliable way to determine
  how good it is at predictions. Use a suite of data from various decades and
  sectors, and use separate test and training sets to analyze it well. Determine
  some factor of confidence in the prediction. Oh and make it visible in the
  dashboard.

- Is the industry of the company included as input parameter for the neural
  network? that data is available from yfinance

# Analyze stocks like Berkshire correctly
  Given the current system's capabilities, here are more feasible ways to
  improve the analysis for such businesses:

   * Focus on Book Value Growth: For companies like Berkshire Hathaway, growth
     in book value per share is often a more meaningful metric
     than traditional revenue or earnings growth. It directly reflects the
     compounding of their underlying assets. We could incorporate
     this as a key growth metric in the screening process.
   * Adjusting Thresholds/Weights: For identified holding companies, we could
     apply different, more lenient growth thresholds, or give
     less weight to traditional growth metrics and more weight to balance sheet
     strength (e.g., high current ratio, low debt-to-equity)
     and overall return on assets/equity, which reflect efficient capital
     deployment.
   * Custom Configuration: We could create a specific configuration file
     tailored for holding companies, with adjusted metrics and
     thresholds.

  In summary, while a full automated Sum-of-the-Parts valuation is complex, we
  can make significant improvements by:
   1. Developing methods to identify these "special kinds" of businesses.
   2. Incorporating more relevant metrics like book value growth.
   3. Adjusting the weighting or thresholds of existing metrics to better
     reflect their unique financial characteristics.
