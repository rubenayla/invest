Si tengo dinero invertido y sufro una ca√≠da generalizada del mercado, probablemente bajar√°n los tipos de inter√©s, con suerte a casi 0.
La pignoraci√≥n implica que el banco me presta un % del valor de mis acciones (que ahora valen menos). Prestan 50-60% del valor de mercado de las acciones si est√°n en un fondo indexado, considerado seguro. Si ten√≠a 100k y ha ca√≠do un 40%, ahora tengo 60k. Al pignorarlos al 50% nos prestan otros 30k, tenemos 90k. Con esto compramos m√°s participaciones, y pasamos a tener 90k en el momento m√°s bajo del mercado.
De media seg√∫n datos hist√≥ricos del sp500 1 a√±o despu√©s subir√° un 40%, la peor situaci√≥n en la historia se dio en 1987 donde s√≥lo subi√≥ un 22.5%. 2 a√±os despu√©s de media un 70%. y 5 a√±os despu√©s un 100%. Para la devoluci√≥n del dinero, pagaremos intereses similares a los tipos de inter√©s. Trimestralmente se pagan los intereses calculados por a√±o, divididos a partes iguales en los 4 trimestres del a√±o. Con 2% anual de tasa de inter√©s ser√≠an 600‚Ç¨, 150‚Ç¨ cada trimestre. En total, los 100k que cayeron a 60k se han transformado en 90*.7=153k-30k (deuda) - 600*2 (intereses 2%) = 121k

> The value of an asset is the present value of its future cash flows, discounted at the required rate of return.

- financing cost = weighted average of cost of equity and cost of debt
    - Cost of equity = risk-free rate + beta * (market return - risk-free rate)
        - Risk-free rate = yield on 10-year government bonds
    - Cost of debt = (Risk-free rate + default spread) * (1 - tax rate)
- Future cash flows
    - Calculate the current ones: Net income (consider the operating one)
    - Free cash flow = after tax operating income * (1 - reinvestment rate)
    > what happens when the company reinvests all its cash flows? It's not giving net income but its intrinsic value is increasing
    Affected by the growth, which increases with reinvestmente rate, and by the % of cash flow that can be extracted, which decreases with reinvestment rate

# notes to really intuitively understand bond markets and its behavior
So right now (2025-06-09) USA interest rates are high, about 5%, yield curve is inverted, which means expectation of recession in the next 1-2 years, and inflation moderately high, trending down but hardly, at about 3%. It's sticky. Right now the rates are expected to stay high for a while, it's time to prepare, so at the end of the year the time may be good to buy bonds, until mid-recession there are investment opportunities and the bonds can be sold at a profit, using the liquidity for investment opportunities.

Inflation is sticky because certain factors caused prices to rise, especially salaries, and once they rise they don't go back down. About housing, mortgage rates are high, which makes potential buyers stay renting. The rates make renting artificially more attractive, raising the short term renting price. Oil may cause price fluctuations affecting the behavior of the fed.

The ideal interest rates behavior is high, giving me more money, but trending down, which means the value of the bond will rise, since bonds with such returns will be scarce. The fed will drop interest rates only if inflation is low enough, or if Trump can convince them.

So ideally i should buy 1yr bonds now, and then when the rates start dropping, buy longer term.

U.S.-domiciled ETFs (like SGOV/SHY) get hit with 15% dividend withholding tax for non-US investors, so choose UCITS ETFs, Ireland-based wrappers.
gpt recommends: iShares $ Treasury Bond 1-3yr UCITS ETF (IB01 / IBGS). 4.7% gross yield to maturity, 1.9 years.
Either IB01 (Xetra: German electronic stock exchange) or IBGS (London)
I found this one at 1 year, even better.

TER of .07%
> Note: IB01 doesn't hold to maturity, they buy and sell constantly, so if rates drop, this won't benefit from the price appreciation of higher-than-market bonds. For that, consider IBGL or IBTL when rates start dropping. They are higher duration, which means more price appreciation when rates drop.
> Gpt: yes, if you don't sell, this etf will accumulate yield internally, reflect that in price appreciation, just like holding T-bills to maturity.

El Federal funds rate es el tipo que la fed cobra para pr√©stamos a 1 d√≠a, anualizado.
La fed controla el tipo efectivo de los bancos ajustando el suyo: Si desean incrementar los tipos, reducen liquidez en la econom√≠a al vender bonos. Eso lo hacen subiendo los tipos de inter√©s que ellos pagan, haciendo que no tenga sentido la compra de bonos a inter√©s inferior. Esto causa la subida de los tipos de inter√©s en el mercado, y la fed absorbe liquidez de la econom√≠a.

Este proceso permite a la fed financiarse, con la pega de tener que pagar grandes intereses. En la discusi√≥n de Trump con Powell, Trump quiere aumentar la liquidez de la econom√≠a con tipos bajos, pero Powell los mantiene altos. Por qu√© los mantiene altos? Para evitar demasiada inflaci√≥n.

Efecto: Imprimir dinero y financiar obras p√∫blicas con ello, aumentando en el proceso la cantidad de dinero circulando en la econom√≠a, por lo tanto los precios suben porque el valor del dinero baja, pero el mismo gobierno vende bonos (pide dinero) con tipos de inter√©s altos, reduciendo la cantidad de dinero en la econom√≠a, con el efecto de eliminar la inflaci√≥n EN EL CORTO PLAZO, ya que tendr√° que devolver los intereses de los bonos en alg√∫n momento (endeudarse infinitamente es una locura). Al bajar los tipos se libera toda la inflaci√≥n acumulada de golpe, y como financie los intereses imprimiendo dinero, la inflaci√≥n ser√° todav√≠a mayor que la original. La causa de la inflaci√≥n sist√©mica a largo plazo, la depreciaci√≥n real del dinero, es la impresi√≥n, no los bonos.

Conclusi√≥n: S√≥lo evita inflaci√≥n a corto plazo, en el futuro el problema ser√° todav√≠a mayor si no baja los tipos.
Estoy con Trump en este caso: deber√≠amos bajar los tipos y permitir que la inflaci√≥n se sufra gradualmente, y ante todo dejar de endeudarnos a intereses tan altos, con el problem√≥n de deuda que ya tenemos.

#
Si la curva de tipos se invierte, es indicador de recesi√≥n porque los tipos bajos a largo plazo solo tienen sentido si hay suficientes personas compr√°ndolos como para mantener un precio inferior al corto-medio plazo. Esto ocurre porque los inversores no creen que puedan conseguir tipos similares con bonos o acciones, o cualquier otro activo a largo plazo. Es decir, esperan que los tipos a corto plazo, no s√≥lo en bonos sino en el mercado en general, bajen en el futuro, y por lo tanto prefieren comprar bonos a largo plazo ahora, aunque tengan un tipo de inter√©s m√°s bajo que los a corto plazo. Si compran un bono a corto plazo con mayor inter√©s, cuando el bono acabe no tendr√°n las mismas oportunidades que tienen ahora durante los a√±os siguentes. Es decir, ellos mismos esperan recesi√≥n, como en un mercado de apuestas.

Sin embargo, el control directo sobre la recesi√≥n lo tiene la fed, al subir los tipos y vaciar la econom√≠a de liquidez, dando rentabilidad a los acreedores y chupando todo el dinero del resto de empresas. B√°sicamente es hacerle dumping a toda la econom√≠a con el dinero de los contribuyentes.

Curva de tipos en 3d: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/03/19/upshot/3d-yield-curve-economic-growth.html

Tipos bajos pueden ser el gobierno queriendo estimular la econom√≠a y dejarse de deudas, o simplemente que no necesitan subir los tipos para financiarse, porque la econom√≠a est√° en la mierda y no hay muchas alternativas m√°s, entonces con poco inter√©s que paguen ya tienen financiaci√≥n.

B√°sicamente pensar que la fed est√° tirando de la curva para arriba cuando se quiere financiar, y el mercado se queda abajo si tiene otras opciones mejores, no le interesa. Para convencerle tienes que tirar m√°s fuerte subiendo mucho. Si la curva est√° abajo es porque o bien no quieres financiarte, o bien el mercado se ofrece f√°cilmente, porque no tiene alternativas mejores.

En el corto plazo, me gusta pensar que la fed provoca recesiones al absorber dinero de la econom√≠a, en vez de pensar que la econom√≠a mejora cuando los tipos suben, porque si fuese as√≠ no tendr√≠a sentido que los tipos a corto plazo aumenten justo cuando vamos a entrar en crisis, que es lo que ha ocurrido hist√≥ricamente.

Otro punto interesante es la expectativa de inflaci√≥n. Como los bonos no est√°n cubiertos, si el dolar de deval√∫a, los bonos tambi√©n. Los bonos altos durante mucho tiempo acumulan liquidez en la fed, que en alg√∫n momento tendr√° que volver, causando inseguridad en los bonos.

# 2025-08-13 -- Working process:
The pre-filter is just the first step to narrow down the universe of stocks. After that, a much more
  sophisticated analysis is performed using a wide range of data to identify the best companies.

  Here‚Äôs a simplified breakdown of the process:

   1. Pre-Filtering: This is the initial step where I select the universe of stocks to analyze. In the last run, this was the entire S&P
      500, which was then filtered down to 441 companies based on the initial criteria in the configuration file (e.g., excluding certain
      sectors).

   2. Detailed Screening: Each of those 441 companies is then subjected to a rigorous screening process based on four key areas:
       * Quality: I analyze metrics like Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), Return on Equity (ROE), and debt-to-equity ratios to assess
         the company's financial health.
       * Value: I look at valuation metrics like the P/E ratio, P/B ratio, and EV/EBITDA to determine if the stock is undervalued.
       * Growth: I examine the company's revenue and earnings growth to see how quickly it's expanding.
       * Risk: I assess the company's risk profile by looking at its beta, which measures its volatility relative to the market.

   3. Composite Score and Ranking: Each company that passes this detailed screening is then assigned a composite score, which is a
      weighted average of its scores in the quality, value, and growth categories. The companies are then ranked based on this composite
      score.

   4. Final Selection: The top-ranked companies from this process are then presented as the final recommendations.

  So, it's a comprehensive, multi-stage process that goes far beyond a simple filter to identify the most promising investment
  opportunities.

# best companies to invest in from sp500 with the process of 2025-08-18
‚ú¶ I have completed the systematic screen of all 500 companies in the S&P 500. After a thorough analysis of the results, here are my top 3
   investment recommendations:

1. HIG (The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.): My top pick. It is an exceptional company that achieved a perfect score of 100 in
    all three of my screening categories: quality, value, and growth. This is a rare achievement that, combined with its low-risk
  profile, makes it a truly outstanding investment opportunity.

1. NEM (Newmont Corporation): A very close second, Newmont also boasts perfect scores in quality, value, and growth. Its impressive
  growth in revenue, earnings, and free cash flow makes it a very attractive investment. However, as a mining company, it is subject
  to the inherent volatility of the commodities market, which makes it a slightly riskier choice than The Hartford.
    - Fluctuates a lot with gold prices so I will discard for now

3. CTSH (Cognizant Technology Solutions): A consistently strong performer, Cognizant also appeared in the top 5 of my previous, more
  limited screen. It is a reliable, high-quality company that offers a great combination of growth and value, making it a safe and
  solid addition to any portfolio.

# valuation models to think about
DFC (Discounted Cash Flow)
Simple Ratios - Graham-style
RIM (Residual Income Model)
Instrinsic value
...

Dividends? RIM tracks book value changes so it naturally includes dividends. Simple ratios do include them too, but DFC should use FCFE instead of FCF, adding Net Borrowing - Dividends paid, or do Total Value = NPV(Future Dividends) + NPV(Terminal Growth Value)

This explains why growth investing outperformed value investing in the 2010s - traditional valuation methods systematically undervalued companies that reinvest efficiently!

# to run all backtests
for config in backtesting/configs/valuation_comparison_*.yaml; do echo "Running $config..."; poetry run python backtesting/run_backtest.py "$config"; echo ""; done

# 
> Our code now doesn't ignore the reinvesting efficiency?

‚óè Exactly right! üéØ

  üîß Enhanced DCF Now Properly Accounts For:

  üí° Reinvestment Efficiency:

  - High ROIC companies (GOOGL: 31.4% ROIC) get higher valuations for retained earnings
  - Low ROIC companies (KO: 0% reinvestment) get lower growth assumptions
  - Sustainable growth based on ROE √ó Retention Ratio

  üìä What Changed:

  Before (Traditional DCF):
  Value = NPV(All FCF projected at same growth rate)
  ‚ùå Assumes all companies reinvest equally efficiently

  Now (Enhanced DCF):
  Value = NPV(Dividends) + NPV(Reinvested FCF √ó ROIC)
  ‚úÖ Different growth rates based on actual reinvestment returns

  üéØ Real Impact:

  - Amazon (268% higher valuation): Recognizes 25%+ reinvestment returns
  - Google (122% higher): Values their R&D and infrastructure investments properly
  - Apple (177% higher): Accounts for buyback efficiency + modest dividends
  - Coca-Cola (18% higher): Recognizes dividend value but no growth premium

  - Growth stocks were systematically undervalued before
  - Mature dividend stocks were slightly overvalued before
  - Original DCF had systematic bias toward assuming all companies could grow equally

So while most stocks get higher valuations, it's because traditional DCF was 
  systematically undervaluing companies with efficient capital allocation. JNJ's lower
  valuation is actually more realistic - it reflects the limited growth opportunities in
  mature industries.

  The enhanced DCF provides fairer, more nuanced valuations based on actual capital
  allocation efficiency!

# 
CNC had low costs due to healthy insurers, but they thought they had sicker ones, so they were surprised when they got a 1.8B payment due to the ACA risk adjustment program. This means it's fundamentally more inefficient, which caused a giant drop that July 2.

How efficient is it now? How much should we pay for it? Let's do a detailed analysis of the company, its competitors, and the industry. Let's use several different valuation methods 


# Choose model
If cash flows are stable and forecastable  ‚Üí Traditional DCF
If buybacks/dividends/reinvestment matter  ‚Üí Enhanced DCF
If you need fast, conservative filters     ‚Üí Simple Ratios
If assets/book & ROE are informative       ‚Üí RIM

# 
DCF is more flexible (danger: you can bend it until it ‚Äúsays what you want‚Äù).

RIM is more conservative (danger: you may underestimate firms with light assets but durable moats, because book equity is small relative to their actual earning power).

So if you‚Äôre worried about being fooled with crazy-high values, DCF is the riskier one.

GIII has no moat, good margins and all but any company could come and do the same
APA is cheap but not realiable income. Could be a good bet if i think oil prices will rise. CVX and XOM are better compounding ones.

# MOH cases
üêª BEAR CASE: $150-170

  Scenario: Regulatory pressure, margin compression, and execution challenges

  Key Assumptions:
  - Medical loss ratios increase to 90%+ due to sicker patient populations
  - Government reimbursement rates decline or grow below inflation
  - Integration challenges from recent acquisitions drag on performance
  - Increased competition in Medicaid managed care markets
  - Economic recession increases bad debt and reduces membership

  Valuation Logic:
  - P/E multiple stays compressed at 6-8x due to uncertainty
  - ROE falls to 15-18% range
  - Revenue growth slows to 5-8%
  - Target Price: $150-170 (current levels justified by risks)

  üéØ BASE CASE: $200-225

  Scenario: Steady execution with modest multiple expansion

  Key Assumptions:
  - Medical loss ratios stabilize around 86-88%
  - Medicaid redetermination headwinds fade by mid-2025
  - Successful integration of recent acquisitions
  - Modest market share gains in existing states
  - Consistent 10-12% revenue growth

  Valuation Logic:
  - P/E multiple expands to 10-12x (still below healthcare peers)
  - ROE maintains 20-25% range
  - Simple ratios model suggests $486, but applying 50% discount for execution risk
  - Target Price: $200-225 (15% upside from current)

  üöÄ BULL CASE: $280-320

  Scenario: Multiple expansion meets strong execution

  Key Assumptions:
  - Medical loss ratios improve to 84-86% through better risk adjustment and care
  management
  - Successful expansion into new states and Medicare Advantage growth
  - Margin expansion from scale efficiencies and technology investments
  - Healthcare sector multiple re-rating as interest rates stabilize
  - Strong cash generation funds accretive acquisitions

  Valuation Logic:
  - P/E multiple expands to 14-16x (in line with UNH at 22x, ANTM at 15x)
  - ROE stays above 20% with improving margins
  - DCF models support $400+ valuations with modest assumption changes
  - Target Price: $280-320 (60-85% upside potential)

  Investment Thesis

  Why MOH is Compelling:
  1. Deeply Undervalued: Trading at 8.6x earnings vs. healthcare peer average of 15-20x
  2. Defensive Moat: Government-sponsored healthcare has stable demand and high switching
   costs
  3. Strong Returns: 24% ROE indicates efficient capital allocation
  4. Recovery Play: Medicaid redetermination pressures are temporary (12-18 months)

  Key Risks:
  1. Regulatory Risk: Government reimbursement rate changes
  2. Execution Risk: Managing medical loss ratios in volatile environment
  3. Integration Risk: Recent acquisitions need successful integration
  4. Macro Risk: Economic downturn could impact state budgets

  Recommendation

  Base Case Target: $210 (21% upside)

  MOH appears significantly undervalued at current levels. The combination of strong
  fundamentals (24% ROE, 15% revenue growth) with a deeply discounted valuation (8.6x
  P/E) suggests the market is overly pessimistic about temporary headwinds. The bear case
   around current prices provides good downside protection, while the bull case offers
  substantial upside if execution improves and multiples normalize.

  Position sizing: Consider a moderate position given the strong value proposition but
  elevated execution risk in the near term.

# PORTFOLIO CLAUDE SUGGESTION 2025-08-21
‚óè Based on this analysis and your investment thesis, here's my recommended portfolio
  allocation:

  Recommended Portfolio Allocation

  Core Allocation (7 Stocks)

  üéØ High Conviction Value Plays (40%)

  MOH - 20% (Highest conviction)
  - Why: Severely undervalued (8.6x P/E, 24% ROE), temporary headwinds
  - Risk: Moderate - regulatory/execution risk but strong fundamentals
  - Expected Return: 30-50% over 12-18 months

  8002.T (Marubeni) - 20% (Japanese value play)
  - Why: 10.8x P/E, 14% ROE, diversified trading company, Japan revival story
  - Risk: Moderate - currency/commodity exposure
  - Expected Return: 15-25% with dividend yield

  üè∞ Quality Anchors (35%)

  BRK.B - 25% (Portfolio foundation)
  - Why: Buffett's cash deployment opportunity, insurance + diversified holdings
  - Risk: Low - ultimate defensive position
  - Expected Return: 8-12% steady compounding

  CVX - 10% (Energy/dividend play)
  - Why: Energy security themes, 3%+ dividend, reasonable valuation
  - Risk: Moderate - commodity cyclical
  - Expected Return: 10-15% with dividends

  üöÄ Growth/Cyclical Bets (25%)

  TSLA - 10% (Controlled speculation)
  - Why: AI/robotics optionality, but overvalued at 193x P/E
  - Risk: High - execution and valuation risk
  - Expected Return: -20% to +30% (high volatility)

  STLD - 8% (Steel cycle play)
  - Why: Infrastructure spending, reasonable 18x P/E
  - Risk: Moderate - cyclical industry
  - Expected Return: 10-20%

  SQM - 7% (Lithium recovery)
  - Why: Low-cost lithium producer, EV recovery play
  - Risk: High - commodity price dependent
  - Expected Return: -10% to +40%

  ---
  üîÑ Additional Suggestions

  Consider Adding:

  META - 5-10% (AI beneficiary)
  - Currently cheap at ~24x P/E for a tech giant
  - AI infrastructure leader with massive user base
  - Strong free cash flow generation

  ORCL - 5% (Cloud/AI play)
  - Database moat + cloud transition
  - AI training infrastructure demand
  - More stable than hyperscaler peers

  Alternative Approach - More Conservative:

  If you want lower risk:
  - Increase BRK.B to 35%
  - Reduce TSLA to 5%
  - Add QCOM (5%) - AI chips + reasonable valuation
  - Add IBM (5%) - AI transformation + dividend

  ---
  üí≠ Portfolio Logic

  Risk Tier Structure:
  - 40% Deep Value (MOH, 8002.T) - High conviction, asymmetric upside
  - 35% Quality (BRK.B, CVX) - Steady compounders, downside protection
  - 25% Growth/Cyclical (TSLA, STLD, SQM) - Higher risk/reward

  Diversification Benefits:
  - Geographic: US (80%), Japan (20%)
  - Sector: Healthcare, Financials, Energy, Materials, Tech
  - Style: Value, Growth, Quality, Cyclical
  - Market Cap: Large to mega-cap focus

  Expected Portfolio Returns:
  - Bear Case: -5% to +5%
  - Base Case: +12% to +18%
  - Bull Case: +25% to +35%

  Key Risk: Overweight in cyclical value vs. growth tech, but that's intentional given
  current valuations.

  Would you prefer the aggressive allocation or the more conservative version?

  MITSY (+13,945% upside) - IGNORE

  - Problem: Currency mismatch (USD price vs Yen fundamentals)
  - Action: DO NOT TRADE - Fix data pipeline first

  BIDU (+1,010% upside) - HIGH RISK/REWARD

  - Problem: Geopolitical discount not captured in models
  - Opportunity: Strong fundamentals (P/E 8.3x, solid FCF)
  - Action: SPECULATIVE BUY - Only if comfortable with China risk

  üìà MY CONSISTENT RECOMMENDATIONS

  Portfolio Allocation:
  1. 40% QCOM - Core position, best risk/reward
  2. 25% ACGL - Defensive value, insurance cycle play
  3. 20% CSCO - Steady dividend, enterprise moat
  4. 10% META - Hold if owned (fair value)
  5. 5% Cash - Wait for better opportunities

  Avoid: NVDA, PLTR, ORCL (all overvalued)
  Speculative: BIDU (only if China-risk tolerant)
  Data Issues: MITSY (currency problems)

‚óè Why PLTR Revenue is Growing 48% üöÄ

  The data shows accelerating growth - from 17% in 2023 to 29% in 2024, with recent quarters hitting $1B+ run rate!

  Primary Growth Drivers:

  1. AI Boom Timing ü§ñ

  - PLTR built AI/ML platforms before the 2023 ChatGPT boom
  - Every enterprise now wants AI analytics capabilities
  - PLTR is a "picks and shovels" play on AI adoption

  2. Government Expansion üèõÔ∏è

  - Defense/intelligence agencies massively increasing AI spending
  - Ukraine war showed importance of data-driven warfare
  - Multi-year contracts provide predictable growth
  - High security clearance = pricing power

  3. Commercial Breakthrough üè¢

  - Finally cracked Fortune 500 adoption after years of trying
  - Land-and-expand model: start with pilot, grow into enterprise-wide
  - Q2 2024: $678M ‚Üí Q2 2025: $1,004M (+48% growth!)

  4. Network Effects Kicking In üîÑ

  - More data = better AI insights = more valuable platform
  - Customers become increasingly dependent (high switching costs)
  - Platform improves as user base grows

  Recent Acceleration Factors:

  - Q4 2024: $828M (+14% QoQ) - big enterprise deals closing
  - Q1 2025: $884M (+7% QoQ) - steady commercial growth
  - Q2 2025: $1,004M (+14% QoQ) - breakthrough $1B quarterly run rate

  Quality of Growth ‚úÖ

  - Recurring: Long-term contracts, not one-time sales
  - Sticky: Deep platform integration, hard to replace
  - Expanding: Existing customers buying more modules
  - Profitable: 80% gross margins, 27% operating margins

  This explains why people recommend PLTR despite high P/E - the revenue growth is real, accelerating, and high-quality. The question is whether 48% growth can continue long enough to
  justify the $159 price.
