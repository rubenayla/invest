# Transaction Log: The "Regulatory Crisis" Rebalance

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Tickers Involved:** MOH, SONY, SYF, BTC, TSLA
**Action:** BUY / REBALANCE
**Capital Deployed:** $5,000

## 1. Context & Trigger
*   **Why now?** The user had $5k to deploy.
*   **Trigger:** **Molina (MOH)** crashed due to "trough year" guidance and unfavorable Medicare rates. **Sony (SONY)** is trading near technical support despite strong sensor growth.
*   **User Sentiment:** User holds TSLA ($3k) and wanted to diversify. Expressed FOMO on SONY.

## 2. The Decision (The "Why")
### The "Aggressive Value" Barbell Strategy
We avoided the general market (S&P 500) because Buffett is net selling. Instead, we picked specific "distressed" value plays.

*   **Molina Healthcare (MOH):** **High Conviction.** The market is panicking over 2026 regulatory rates (Advance Notice). History shows rates usually improve in the Final Notice (April). We are buying the "political fear."
*   **Sony Group (SONY):** **Sum-of-Parts.** Market hates the slowing PS5 sales (bad narrative) but ignores the booming Image Sensor monopoly (good reality).
*   **Synchrony (SYF):** **Safety.** Trading at ~5x earnings with massive buybacks. A hedge against the volatility of the other picks.

## 3. Execution Details
| Ticker | Action | Amount ($) | Allocation | Price Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MOH** | BUY | **$2,250** | 45% | **Market.** Immediate execution to catch the dip. |
| **SONY** | BUY | **$750** | 15% | **Market.** To cure FOMO and lock exposure. |
| **SONY** | BUY LIMIT | **$1,000** | 20% | **Limit @ $21.75.** To catch technical support dip. |
| **SYF** | BUY | **$750** | 15% | **Market.** |
| **BTC** | BUY | **$250** | 5% | **DCA.** $50/week for 5 weeks (Macro hedge). |
| **TSLA** | HOLD | -- | -- | Retaining existing ~$3k position. No new capital. |

## 4. Risk & Exit Plan
*   **MOH:** Watch April 2026 Final Rate Announcement. If rates don't improve, thesis weakens. Critical support ~$110.
*   **SONY:** If stock breaks below **$20.00**, the technical trend is broken.
*   **TSLA:** Holding for the 2026/2027 Robotaxi narrative. Ignore auto margin noise.
