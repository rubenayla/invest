# Test Results - 2025-10-31

## ✅ Unified GBM Script Test

**Script**: `scripts/run_gbm_predictions.py`

### Test Command
```bash
uv run python scripts/run_gbm_predictions.py --variant standard --horizon 1y
```

### Results

**✅ SUCCESS** - Script executed successfully with database schema fix

**Execution Time**: ~4 minutes (mostly feature engineering)

**Statistics**:
- Loaded: 3,268 historical snapshots
- Features engineered: 471 columns
- Predictions made: 634 stocks
- Saved to database: 589 predictions
- Skipped: 45 stocks (no current price data)

**Top 5 Predictions**:
1. PTON: 43.87%
2. LYFT: 43.50%
3. UBER: 41.91%
4. ZS: 41.91%
5. COIN: 41.85%

**Confidence Distribution**:
- High confidence: 259 stocks (41%)
- Medium confidence: 375 stocks (59%)

### Database Verification

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM valuation_results WHERE model_name = 'gbm_1y';
-- Result: 589 predictions saved with timestamp 2025-10-31 23:01:42
```

## Issue Fixed

### Problem
Old scripts referenced `snapshots` table which was renamed to `fundamental_history` in the database.

### Solution
Updated unified script to use correct table names:
- `snapshots` → `fundamental_history`
- Alias `s` → `fh` (for fundamental_history)

### CLAUDE.md Updated
Added rule: **DATABASE IS SOURCE OF TRUTH - NOT SCRIPTS**

When there's a mismatch between database schema and scripts, always trust the database and fix the scripts.

## Next Steps

**Ready to run all GBM variants:**
```bash
# Run all 6 GBM variants
uv run python scripts/run_all_predictions.py --models gbm

# Or run everything
uv run python scripts/run_all_predictions.py
```

**Note**: Other GBM variants (lite, opportunistic) and horizons (3y) should now work with the same fix.

## Code Quality Improvements Summary

### Before Today
- 6 separate GBM scripts (2,520 lines)
- Duplicate code across variants
- No unified way to run all predictions
- Scripts had outdated database references

### After Today
- ✅ 1 unified GBM script (550 lines) - **saves 1,970 lines**
- ✅ Scripts use correct database schema
- ✅ 2 ways to run all predictions (shell + Python)
- ✅ Database indexes for performance
- ✅ Colored output with timing
- ✅ CLAUDE.md updated with database-first rule

**Lines saved**: ~1,970
**Maintainability**: 6× easier (change once instead of 6 times)
