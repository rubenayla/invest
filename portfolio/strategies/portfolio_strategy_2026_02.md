# Investment Allocation Strategy ($5,000 + Trim)
**Date:** Feb 7, 2026

**Note:** User retains existing TSLA ($3k) and 60% of Marubeni (~$4.2k).

## 💰 The "Aggressive Value" Barbell
New capital ($5k) plus Marubeni profits ($2.8k) are deployed into **Deep Value** and **Tech Diversification**.

| Ticker | Company | Role | Allocation % | Amount ($) | Buy Limit / Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MOH** | Molina Healthcare | **Anchor** | 45% | **$2,250** | **Market.** Buying the "regulatory crisis" dip. |
| **SONY** | Sony Group | **Tech Value** | 35% | **$1,750** | **Split Buy.** $750 Market / $1,000 Limit @ **$21.75**. |
| **SYF** | Synchrony Financial | **Cash Flow** | 15% | **$750** | **Market.** |
| **BTC** | Bitcoin | **Hedge** | 5% | **$250** | **DCA.** $50/week for 5 weeks. |
| **8002.T** | Marubeni | **House Money** | -- | **($2,800)** | **SELL 40%.** Take principal off the table. |

## 📉 Execution Plan

1.  **Phase 1: Harvest (The Sell)**
    *   Sell **40%** of Marubeni (8002.T) position (~¥420,000 / ~$2,800).

2.  **Phase 2: Deploy (The Buys)**
    *   Buy **$2,250** of **MOH**.
    *   Buy **$750** of **SYF**.
    *   Buy **$750** of **SONY**.
    *   Buy **$50** of **BTC**.

3.  **Phase 3: Set & Forget**
    *   Set Limit Buy for **SONY**: ~$1,000 @ **$21.75**.
    *   Set recurring **BTC** buy for remaining **$200**.

## 🛡 Risk Management
*   **Marubeni:** We secured the principal. Even if the fundamental crash (-75%) happens, we already "won" this trade.
*   **Model Divergence:** We are explicitly betting *against* the DCF model on Marubeni (by keeping 60%) because the Momentum (GBM) is too strong to ignore.
