# Transaction Log: The "Regulatory Crisis" Rebalance & Japan Trim

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Tickers Involved:** MOH, SONY, SYF, BTC, TSLA, 8002.T
**Action:** BUY / REBALANCE / TRIM
**Capital Deployed:** $5,000 (New) + $2,800 (from Marubeni trim)

## 1. Context & Trigger
*   **Why now?** The user had $5k to deploy. Additionally, discovered that **Marubeni (8002.T)** had grown to a massive ~$7,000 position (+160% gain).
*   **Trigger:** **Molina (MOH)** crashed on "trough year" guidance. **Marubeni** showed a dangerous divergence between Momentum (GBM) and Fundamentals (DCF).
*   **User Sentiment:** User wanted to secure profits on Marubeni and diversify into Tech (SONY).

## 2. The Decision (The "Why")
### The "Aggressive Value" Barbell Strategy
We are funding new value plays by taking profits from a massive winner.

*   **Molina Healthcare (MOH):** **High Conviction.** Buying the "political fear" ahead of the April rate restoration.
*   **Sony Group (SONY):** **Sum-of-Parts.** Diversifying Japan exposure from "Old Economy" (Marubeni) to "New Economy" (Sensors/AI).
*   **Marubeni (8002.T):** **The 40% Trim.**
    *   **The Divergence:** GBM model showed **+164% momentum** but DCF showed **-75% overvaluation**. 
    *   **Logic:** Lock in principal and some profit. Let the remaining 60% (House Money) ride the momentum rocket with Buffett.
