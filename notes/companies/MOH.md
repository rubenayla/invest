# Molina Healthcare Inc. (MOH)

**Sector**: Healthcare (Managed Care)  
**Current Price**: ~$132 (Feb 2026)  
**Forward P/E**: ~6.3  

## 🚨 Strategic Analysis: Feb 2026 (The "Trough" Opportunity)

**The "Dumb" DCF View:** **Buy / Undervalued**
- Quantitative models see strong historical cash flows and a cheap price, flagging it as a "Strong Buy."

**The "Strategic Reality" (Why it crashed):**
The "value" is real, but so is the regulatory shock.

1.  **The "Crash" Drivers:**
    - **Medicaid Redeterminations:** States resumed checking eligibility, causing MOH to lose ~500k members (80% of revenue is Medicaid).
    - **Earnings Miss:** Q4 2025 was a disaster ($2.75 loss vs profit expected) due to a "Medical Cost Ratio" spike to 94.6%.
    - **Guidance Cut:** 2026 profit outlook slashed by ~63% (from ~$13.71 expected to ~$5.00).

2.  **The Turnaround Thesis:**
    - **"Trough Year":** Management calls 2026 the bottom.
    - **Rate Restoration:** State Medicaid rates usually lag cost spikes by 12-18 months. July 2026 renewals should bring rate hikes to match the new, sicker member pool.
    - **Strategic Exits:** They are exiting the unprofitable Medicare Advantage Part D business in 2027.

### Why are Medical Prices Increasing? (The "Triple Whammy")
Insurers are getting hit by three simultaneous inflation drivers:
1.  **"Revenge" Utilization:** Post-COVID, seniors are finally getting delayed surgeries (knees, hips) and checkups.
2.  **Labor Costs:** Hospitals are paying nurses/staff 20-30% more than 3 years ago, passing these costs to insurers.
3.  **The "Ozempic Effect" (GLP-1s):** Demand for weight loss drugs ($1,000/mo) exploded in 2024/2025. This was an unbudgeted multi-billion dollar hit to the industry.

### The "Negotiation Dance" (Government Promises)
*User Question: "Is there evidence of rates rising after promises?"*
**YES.** It is a standard cycle:
1.  **Jan (Advance Notice):** CMS proposes a low rate (e.g., +0.09%). Stocks crash.
2.  **Feb/Mar (Lobbying):** Insurers and seniors lobby Congress.
3.  **April (Final Notice):** CMS "magically" finds new data.
    - **Example (2026 Cycle):** Advance Notice estimated ~5.9% effective growth. Final Notice raised it to ~9%.
    - **Bet:** We are betting this cycle repeats in April 2026 for the 2027 rates.

**Verdict:**
- **High Conviction Value Play.** The market has priced in "permanent impairment." If margins merely revert to the mean in 2027, the stock doubles.
- **Risk:** If medical costs spiral further before rates catch up, they could burn cash in 2026.

## Position
- Holding: €6,000 (≈$6.5k) accumulated during the 2025 selloff.
- Role: Defensive core position; target 8-10% of portfolio for steady cash flows vs. cyclicals.

## Thesis
1. Medicaid/ACA enrollment still expanding; MOH continues to capture share.
2. ROE near 20% with net cash balance sheet allows buybacks and bolt-on deals.
3. Street punished the stock alongside CNC despite MOH’s stronger underwriting; mean reversion to $200+ offers 20-30% upside.

## Risks
- Policy/regulatory changes to premium rates.
- Medical cost trend surprises (e.g., higher utilization) hurting margins.
- Concentration in government programs keeps reimbursement risk elevated.

## Status Update: Feb 2026 (The "Trough" Year)

**Context**: Stock has suffered a sharp decline following Q4 2025 results (Feb 5, 2026) and unfavorable 2027 Medicare Advantage rate proposals.

### 1. The "Scissors Effect" (Q4 2025 Miss)
Molina is currently squeezed between rising medical costs and lagging premium adjustments.
- **Q4 Performance**: Adjusted loss of $2.75/share vs. expected profit of ~$0.43.
- **MCR Spike**: Medical Care Ratio hit **94.6%** (vs. historical 88-89% norm).
- **Drivers**: Higher utilization in Medicaid (behavioral health, pharmacy) and retroactive revenue adjustments in California.

### 2. The 2027 Advance Notice (The "Cold Shower")
CMS released preliminary 2027 rates in late Jan 2026, shocking the industry.
- **Headline Hike**: Proposed **+0.09%** (vs. +5.06% in 2026 and expected 4-6%).
- **"Real" Revenue**: CMS claims +2.54% after risk adjustments; insurers argue this is a real-dollar cut relative to inflation/utilization.
- **Chart Review Crackdown**: New rule excluding "unlinked" chart reviews (diagnoses without a specific doctor encounter in the same year) hits revenue generation strategies hard.

### 3. Strategic Pivot & Outlook
CEO Joseph Zubretsky has labeled 2026 as the **"trough year"**.
- **Exit**: Exiting Medicare Advantage Part D (standalone drug plans) in 2027 due to lack of profitability.
- **Rate Restoration**: Expecting state Medicaid rates to eventually catch up to cost trends, but cash flow benefits won't appear until late 2026/Jan 2027.

### 4. Key Catalyst Timeline
- **April 6, 2026**: **Final Rate Announcement** for Medicare Advantage. (Watch for any improvement over the 0.09% proposal).
- **July 2026**: State Medicaid rate renewal cycles begin (e.g., FL, CA). First chance for premiums to adjust to 2025's high costs.
- **Jan 1, 2027**: New fiscal year where "rate restoration" and cleaned-up portfolio (post-MAPD exit) should align.
