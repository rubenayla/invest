# Molina Healthcare Inc. (MOH)

**Sector**: Healthcare (Managed Care)  
**Current Price**: $162.84  
**Forward P/E**: ~6.3  

## Position
- Holding: €6,000 (≈$6.5k) accumulated during the 2025 selloff.
- Role: Defensive core position; target 8-10% of portfolio for steady cash flows vs. cyclicals.

## Thesis
1. Medicaid/ACA enrollment still expanding; MOH continues to capture share.
2. ROE near 20% with net cash balance sheet allows buybacks and bolt-on deals.
3. Street punished the stock alongside CNC despite MOH’s stronger underwriting; mean reversion to $200+ offers 20-30% upside.

## Risks
- Policy/regulatory changes to premium rates.
- Medical cost trend surprises (e.g., higher utilization) hurting margins.
- Concentration in government programs keeps reimbursement risk elevated.

## Status Update: Feb 2026 (The "Trough" Year)

**Context**: Stock has suffered a sharp decline following Q4 2025 results (Feb 5, 2026) and unfavorable 2027 Medicare Advantage rate proposals.

### 1. The "Scissors Effect" (Q4 2025 Miss)
Molina is currently squeezed between rising medical costs and lagging premium adjustments.
- **Q4 Performance**: Adjusted loss of $2.75/share vs. expected profit of ~$0.43.
- **MCR Spike**: Medical Care Ratio hit **94.6%** (vs. historical 88-89% norm).
- **Drivers**: Higher utilization in Medicaid (behavioral health, pharmacy) and retroactive revenue adjustments in California.

### 2. The 2027 Advance Notice (The "Cold Shower")
CMS released preliminary 2027 rates in late Jan 2026, shocking the industry.
- **Headline Hike**: Proposed **+0.09%** (vs. +5.06% in 2026 and expected 4-6%).
- **"Real" Revenue**: CMS claims +2.54% after risk adjustments; insurers argue this is a real-dollar cut relative to inflation/utilization.
- **Chart Review Crackdown**: New rule excluding "unlinked" chart reviews (diagnoses without a specific doctor encounter in the same year) hits revenue generation strategies hard.

### 3. Strategic Pivot & Outlook
CEO Joseph Zubretsky has labeled 2026 as the **"trough year"**.
- **Exit**: Exiting Medicare Advantage Part D (standalone drug plans) in 2027 due to lack of profitability.
- **Rate Restoration**: Expecting state Medicaid rates to eventually catch up to cost trends, but cash flow benefits won't appear until late 2026/Jan 2027.

### 4. Key Catalyst Timeline
- **April 6, 2026**: **Final Rate Announcement** for Medicare Advantage. (Watch for any improvement over the 0.09% proposal).
- **July 2026**: State Medicaid rate renewal cycles begin (e.g., FL, CA). First chance for premiums to adjust to 2025's high costs.
- **Jan 1, 2027**: New fiscal year where "rate restoration" and cleaned-up portfolio (post-MAPD exit) should align.
