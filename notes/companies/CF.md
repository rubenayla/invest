## Score Breakdown

| Component | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Quality | 87 | ROE 22%, Op margin 34%, Current ratio 2.27 |
| Value | 93 | P/E 10.5, DCF +74%, RIM +66% |
| Growth | 79 | Revenue +21% YoY (but off peak) |
| Risk | 74 | D/E 0.71, cyclical sector |
| Catalyst | 52 | 16% off 52w high |

## Financial History

| Year | Revenue | Net Income | FCF |
|------|---------|------------|-----|
| 2021 | $6.5B | $0.9B | $2.4B |
| **2022** | **$11.2B** | **$3.4B** | **$3.4B** |
| 2023 | $6.6B | $1.5B | $1.0B |
| 2024 | $5.9B | $1.2B | $1.8B |

**Key insight:** 2022 was an anomaly driven by Russia-Ukraine war spiking fertilizer prices globally. Earnings have been normalizing since.

## Valuation Models

| Model | Fair Value | Upside |
|-------|------------|--------|
| DCF Enhanced | $179 | +107% |
| DCF | $151 | +74% |
| RIM | $144 | +66% |
| Multi-stage DCF | $140 | +61% |
| Neural Network | $119 | +37% |
| GBM Lite 3y | $109 | +26% |
| GBM 3y | $80 | **-8%** |

**Model divergence:** Traditional DCF models very bullish. GBM (gradient boosting) models more skeptical, suggesting mean reversion in earnings.

## Analyst Consensus

- Average target: $91.60 (+6%)
- Low: $78 (-10%) - BofA Underperform
- High: $110 (+27%)
- Zacks Rank: #3 Hold, expects +32.8% earnings growth 2025

## Bull Case

1. **Structural demand** - Nitrogen linked to food production, population growth
2. **Cost advantage** - North American natural gas cheaper than international
3. **Strong operations** - 97% ammonia utilization, 10M tons production
4. **Clean energy optionality** - Blue ammonia/carbon capture projects ($150-200M annual FCF by 2030)
5. **Capital returns** - Strong FCF supports buybacks

## Bear Case

1. **Cyclical peak** - 2022 earnings were 3x normal, still normalizing
2. **Natural gas risk** - Rising domestic gas prices pressure margins
3. **China dumping** - Elevated urea inventory driving aggressive exports
4. **Demand pressure** - U.S. corn acreage expected to drop 5% in 2026 (farmers switching to soybeans due to UAN price +30%)
5. **DCF models may be wrong** - Using current earnings that are still above-trend

## Key Risks

- **Input costs**: Natural gas is primary raw material
- **Commodity cyclicality**: Fertilizer prices volatile
- **Trade policy**: Tariffs could affect competitive position
- **Weather**: Agricultural demand weather-dependent

## Verdict

**Value trap risk: MEDIUM-HIGH**

The scanner correctly identified CF as statistically cheap, but this appears to be a classic cyclical value trap situation:
- Low P/E on potentially still-elevated earnings
- DCF models don't adequately account for cyclicality
- GBM models (which learn patterns) are skeptical

**If you believe:**
- Nitrogen demand stays strong, prices stabilize → genuinely undervalued
- Cycle continues normalizing → could have more downside

**Normalized valuation:** If earnings normalize to $800M-1B (vs current $1.2B), fair P/E of 12-15x suggests $60-90 range. Current price near top of that range.

**Action:** WATCH, don't chase. Would consider on pullback to $70-75 range where normalized earnings provide better margin of safety.
