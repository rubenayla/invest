# Sony Group Corp. (SONY)

**Sector**: Consumer Electronics / Entertainment
**Current Price**: ~$22.26 (Feb 2026)
**Verdict**: **STRONG BUY** (Sum-of-the-Parts Mispricing)

## 🚨 Strategic Analysis: Feb 2026 (The Hidden Gem)

**The "Dumb" DCF View:** **Buy / Massive Upside**
- Even correcting for data artifacts (Yen/USD), Sony is a cash cow trading at a discount.

**The "Strategic Reality" (Why it's mispriced):**
The market is obsessing over the "PlayStation Slowdown" and ignoring the "Sensor Boom."

1.  **The "Bad News" (Console Fatigue):**
    - PS5 sales have peaked and are declining (-16% YoY).
    - The console cycle is aging, and hardware sales are naturally slowing.
    - Market Narrative: "Sony is a declining hardware company."

2.  **The "Hidden Gem" (I&SS - Imaging & Sensing Solutions):**
    - **Monopoly Power:** Sony dominates the global image sensor market (iPhone cameras, high-end Android, automotive).
    - **Booming Growth:** I&SS operating income surged **+35%**.
    - **Outlook:** Aiming for 60% global market share. As phones add more/bigger cameras and cars add autonomy sensors, Sony wins.

3.  **Sum-of-the-Parts:**
    - You are buying the Image Sensor monopoly + Music/Movies catalog at a discount because of the gaming slowdown.
    - Currency Benefit: A weaker Yen boosts their repatriated profits, further aiding the bottom line.

## 🎯 Buy Targets & Strategy (Curing FOMO)

**Technical Analysis (Feb 2026):**
- **Current Price:** ~$22.26
- **Smart Buy Zone:** **$21.50 – $21.80** (Strong historical support level).
- **Resistance:** ~$25.43

**Execution Strategy (Scale In):**
Do not chase the green candle.
1.  **Immediate:** Buy **30%** of intended position at market (~$22.26) to lock in exposure and cure FOMO.
2.  **Limit Order:** Set buy order for remaining **70%** at **$21.75**.
3.  **Logic:** If it rallies, you participate. If it drops to support, you lower your cost basis significantly.

**Action:**
- Ignore the "5000% upside" data artifact.
- **Buy** for the strategic shift from "Console Hardware" to "Sensors & Content."
