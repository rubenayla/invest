## Investment View
Carrefour is a defensive grocery retailer with structurally thin margins. It can look "cheap" on forward earnings, but small operational or cost shocks can wipe out profit given the low profitability profile.

### Why It Could Work
- **Defensive demand** (food retail) can stabilize revenue in downturns.
- **Valuation can re-rate** if margins/earnings normalize and stay stable.
- Local cache financials show **large absolute FCF** in recent years (needs verification vs capex/working capital sustainability).

### Key Risks / What Must Be True
- **Margin fragility**: with ~1-2% operating margin, execution matters a lot.
- **Leverage + liquidity**: higher D/E and sub-1 current ratio reduce flexibility.
- **Value trap risk**: "low forward P/E" is only real if earnings are durable.

## What I Would Watch
- Evidence of **sustained margin improvement** (not one-off quarters).
- Net debt trend and **refinancing risk** (rates, maturities).
- FCF consistency vs inventory/working-capital swings.

## Decision
- **Neutral / watch** unless you have a strong margin + FCF durability thesis.
