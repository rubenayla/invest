# Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU)

**Sector**: Consumer Discretionary (Athleisure Retail)
**Current Price**: $164.16
**Market Cap**: ~$19.7B
**Valuation**: ~11× trailing / ~11× forward EPS
**Position**: None (watchlist candidate)

> **Alert plan**
> - Accumulate starter position if shares revisit **$150** (prior support + <10× forward EPS).
> - Add aggressively on sustained recovery above **$190** only if comps reaccelerate (>10% YoY).  
> - Reassess thesis if price closes **below $135** or revenue growth drops <3%.

## Quick Metrics (yfinance)
- Revenue Growth: +6.5% YoY (decelerating but positive)
- Earnings Growth: -1.6% (margin compression priced in)
- Operating Margin: 20.7%
- Profit Margin: 16.4%
- ROE: 42%
- Debt/Equity: ~40% (manageable, plenty of cash)

## Thesis
1. **Brand & Pricing Power** – Still the premium athleisure brand with high repeat purchase rates and low markdowns.
2. **International & Mens Growth** – Canada/US mature but APAC & men’s apparel growing >20% YoY, driving mix shift.
3. **Balance Sheet Strength** – Net cash, consistent FCF, share repurchases resumed; can invest through downturns.
4. **Multiple Reset** – At ~11× earnings, market already priced in slowdown; even mid-teens P/E implies $200+ target if growth stabilizes.

## Risks
- **North America Comps** – Mid-single digit growth could stall if consumer discretionary budgets tighten.
- **Competition** – Nike/Athleta/fast-fashion copycat products may pressure margins.
- **Execution** – Inventory missteps or supply-chain issues like 2022 would hurt margins again.
- **Macro** – Recession would delay international store rollout and discretionary spend.

## Monitoring
- Monthly traffic & comps (company, Placer.ai, third-party data).
- Gross margin trend (should hold >57%).
- Inventory growth vs. sales (<10% ideal).
- International store count & men’s penetration.
- Keep alerts at $150 (buy), $190 (confirm momentum), and $135 (thesis review).
