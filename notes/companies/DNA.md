# Ginkgo Bioworks (DNA)

**Sector**: Biotechnology / Synthetic Biology
**Current Price**: Volatile / Distressed
**Verdict**: **Speculative Venture Capital Bet**

## 🚨 Strategic Analysis: Feb 2026 (Survival Mode)

**User Question:** *"1-for-40 reverse split is merging 40 shares in 1?"*
- **YES.** On Aug 20, 2024, Ginkgo executed a 1-for-40 reverse split.
- **Meaning:** If you had 400 shares at $0.25 (Total $100), you now have 10 shares at $10.00 (Total $100).
- **Reason:** To keep the stock price above $1.00 and avoid being delisted from the NYSE. It does *not* change the value of the company, but it is often a sign of distress.

**User Question:** *"Why does the chart look like it's going down since inception?"*
- **The "SPAC Curse":** DNA went public via a SPAC at a massive valuation based on hype ("The AWS of Biology").
- **Reality Check:** They have burned billions in cash without proving a scalable, profitable business model. The chart is the market slowly deflating that initial hype bubble as cash reserves dwindled.

**The "Strategic Reality" Today:**
1.  **Survival Plan:**
    - Aggressive cost cutting (aiming for breakeven in late 2026).
    - Cash burn reduced by 75% (Q3 '24 vs Q3 '25).
    - **Pivot:** Moving from high-touch "services" (doing the science for you) to high-margin "tools/data" (selling the data/platform).

2.  **The Bull Case (The Gamble):**
    - Partnership with Google Cloud to build an "AI for Biology."
    - If they survive to profitability, their data assets are unique and valuable.

**Verdict:**
- **Avoid** unless you treat it as a VC ticket.
- **Risk:** High probability of zero if they run out of cash in mid-2026 before hitting breakeven.
