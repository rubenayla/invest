## Investment View
This is not a normal long-term investment candidate under standard quality/value criteria. It is a microcap with extreme drawdown, weak liquidity, high leverage (relative), and very poor profitability in the cached snapshot.

### Why People Touch It Anyway
- Purely as a **high-risk catalyst trade** (news-driven) where position sizing assumes potential total loss.

### Key Risks / What Must Be True
- **Going-concern / dilution risk**: microcaps often survive by issuing equity.
- **Liquidity risk**: spreads and slippage can dominate returns.
- **Fundamentals are broken** in the snapshot; any long thesis requires a credible turnaround path.

## What I Would Watch (If Speculating)
- Evidence of **cash burn reduction** and financing plan that is not massively dilutive.
- Any concrete catalyst (contracts, product traction, audited improvements).
- Volume/liquidity regime changes (to avoid getting trapped).

## Decision
- **Avoid as an investment.** Only consider as a very small, explicitly speculative position with a catalyst thesis.
