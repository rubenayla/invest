## Why the Stock Spiked Then Faded (Feb 18)

Stock popped ~1-3% on the beat, then reversed. Reasons:

1. **Sequential deceleration** — Q1 guide $305M midpoint vs Q4's $335M
2. **Margin durability questionable** — Q4 margins boosted by U.S.-made product mix and lower seasonal warranty costs; may not persist
3. **Tariffs treated as "ongoing cost"** — management won't quantify impact, creates uncertainty
4. **Nexis platform not shipping until Q3 2026** — high-volume; AI data center revenue not until 2027
5. **Still deeply GAAP-unprofitable** — $132M net loss in Q4 alone
6. **Classic "sell the news"** after run-up into earnings

## Structural Concerns

- **5-year revenue CAGR: -4.1%** — the recovery is from a deep trough, not a growth trajectory
- **Operating margin historically: -15.7%** average — structurally unprofitable
- **Thin cash cushion** — $244M net cash is low for a company still burning on GAAP basis
- **Solar sector is politically/cyclically volatile** — tariffs, subsidies, interest rates all affect demand
- **Competition** — Enphase, Chinese inverter makers gaining ground; management pulling back to "selective markets"

## Bull Case

- Revenue bottomed; 70% YoY growth shows recovery
- FCF turned positive ($77M in 2025 vs -$421M in 2024)
- Nexis platform + AI data center power = optionality for 2027+
- If margins sustain 23%+ and revenue grows, re-rating possible
- Tariff drawback mechanism could recover some costs on U.S. exports

## Bear Case

- Recovery is just refilling depleted channel inventory, not organic demand growth
- Margins propped up by temporary factors (U.S. product mix, warranty timing)
- Tariff headwinds + rate sensitivity could stall residential solar demand
- Management retreating to "selective markets" = losing competitive ground
- Path to consistent GAAP profitability is unclear
- Growth catalysts (Nexis, AI data centers) are 2-4 quarters away

## Valuation Context

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| EV/Sales (TTM) | ~1.9x |
| EV/Sales (fwd) | ~1.7x |
| P/E | N/A (unprofitable) |
| Price/Book | Low but book value declining |

Cheap on revenue multiples, but the company isn't profitable. You're paying for a turnaround that hasn't proven sustainable margins yet.

## Decision

**SKIP** — Too much uncertainty for the risk profile.

- Another unprofitable turnaround bet, similar risk profile to PTON but with worse unit economics (hardware-only, no recurring subscription revenue like PTON's 72% margin subs)
- Solar is more cyclically/politically exposed than fitness
- The Q4 beat looks good, but guidance is softer and the margin story is unproven
- If you want solar exposure, wait for 2-3 quarters of sustained 20%+ margins and revenue growth before entry
- Better risk/reward opportunities exist (see GOOG comparison below)

## vs Adding to GOOG

See [GOOGL.md](GOOGL.md) for full thesis.

| Factor | SEDG | GOOG |
|--------|------|------|
| Profitability | GAAP loss, -$132M in Q4 | $73B FCF, massively profitable |
| Balance Sheet | $244M net cash (thin) | >$100B net cash |
| Revenue Trend | Recovering from trough (-4% 5yr CAGR) | +36% YoY, structural growth |
| Moat | Commodity hardware, price competition | Search monopoly + AI + Cloud |
| Downside Risk | High — could revisit lows if solar demand stalls | Low — massive cash cushion |
| Upside Optionality | Nexis + AI data centers (2027+) | Gemini AI across products (now) |
| Valuation | 1.9x EV/Sales (cheap but unprofitable) | ~22x P/E (reasonable for quality) |
| Catalysts | Distant (Q3 2026 - 2027) | Ongoing (AI integration, buybacks) |

**Verdict**: GOOG is the clear winner here. You already have one speculative turnaround (PTON). Adding SEDG would double down on the "unprofitable company hoping to turn the corner" playbook. GOOG gives you compounding cash flow, AI optionality, and Berkshire backing with far less downside risk.
