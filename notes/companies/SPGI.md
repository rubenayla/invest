## Thesis

S&P Global is one of the highest-quality franchises in financial markets, operating a duopoly in credit ratings (with Moody's, ~80% combined market share), a legal monopoly on the most-tracked indices in the world, and growing data businesses with deep switching costs. The stock is 28% off its highs with a respected director buying $1M at current levels and 32% earnings growth — a rare opportunity to buy a compounding machine at a relative discount. The primary risk is valuation, not business quality.

## Business Model

Five segments, each with strong pricing power:

| Segment | Description | Moat Type |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Ratings** | Credit ratings for bond issuers (S&P) | Regulatory duopoly — NRSRO designation required by SEC/Basel III |
| **S&P Dow Jones Indices** | Licensing fees from ETFs/funds tracking S&P 500 and other indices | Legal/brand monopoly — only SPGI can license "the S&P 500" |
| **Market Intelligence** | Data, analytics, and research platforms for financial professionals | Switching costs, proprietary datasets |
| **Commodity Insights** | Platts commodity price benchmarks (energy, metals, agriculture) | Market standard benchmarks; contracts reference Platts prices |
| **Mobility** | Automotive data and analytics (IHS Markit legacy) | Deep integration into auto industry workflows |

Key structural advantage: index licensing revenue grows automatically as the market cap of S&P 500 constituent companies grows — no incremental cost to SPGI.

## Fundamentals

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| P/E | 28.5x | Reasonable for franchise quality; not cheap |
| P/B | 4.0x | Reflects intangible-heavy business |
| Current Ratio | 0.8 | Below 1 — watch liquidity |
| ROE | 13.1% | Understated due to goodwill from IHS Markit merger |
| D/E | 0.4 | Conservative leverage |
| Operating Margin | 38.3% | Best-in-class for financial data sector |
| Profit Margin | 29.2% | — |
| Revenue Growth (TTM) | 9.0% | Steady compounder |
| Earnings Growth (TTM) | 32.0% | Strong — margins expanding post-merger integration |

## Insider Activity (180 days)

**Summary: 4 buys / 0 sells | 100% net buying | ~$1.0M total conviction**

| Date | Person | Role | Shares | Price | Value | Note |
|------|--------|------|--------|-------|-------|------|
| Feb 2026 | Hubert Joly | Director | 2,301 | $399 | $918K | Near 52w low — high conviction |
| Feb 2026 | Hubert Joly | Director | 199 | $399 | $79.5K | Same date, separate transaction |
| Dec 2025 | William Eager | President | 12 | $493 | $6K | Likely stock purchase plan |
| Sep 2025 | William Eager | President | 11 | $544 | $6K | Likely stock purchase plan |

Hubert Joly is the former CEO of Best Buy, known for executing one of the most celebrated corporate turnarounds of the last decade. His $1M open-market purchase at $399 — near 52-week lows — is not a routine transaction. This is a capital allocator with a strong track record signaling conviction in the franchise.

## Valuation

Model outputs at current price $417.48:

| Model | Price Target | Upside |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| GBM Opp 3y | $624 | +49.4% |
| GBM Opp 1y | $607 | +45.3% |
| GBM Lite 3y | $579 | +38.8% |
| GBM Lite 1y | $497 | +19.0% |
| GBM 1y | $469 | +12.4% |

**Opportunity Score: 49.3** (Quality=74.4, Value=26.9, Growth=46.6, Risk=51.2, Catalyst=54.8)

The low Value score (26.9) reflects the market's recognition that this is a premium franchise. The quality score (74.4) is the anchor of the thesis.

## Bull Case

- **Unassailable moat**: Credit ratings duopoly backed by regulation; index licensing is a legal monopoly on the world's most referenced benchmarks.
- **Insider conviction**: Hubert Joly's $1M open-market purchase at $399 — a highly respected capital allocator buying near 52w lows — carries genuine signal weight.
- **Earnings acceleration**: 32% earnings growth shows the IHS Markit merger integration is delivering cost synergies.
- **Automatic compounder**: S&P 500 index licensing fees grow passively as equity market caps rise.
- **Low leverage**: D/E 0.4 with 38% operating margins creates significant capacity for buybacks and dividends.
- **28% below 52w high**: Entry at a relative discount for a franchise of this quality is historically uncommon.

---

## Bear Case

- **Valuation not cheap**: P/E 28.5x on 9% revenue growth is a high multiple; the stock can de-rate on any macro softening.
- **Current ratio below 1**: 0.8 is not alarming for a cash-generative business, but it is worth monitoring.
- **Low Value score (26.9)**: The market prices in the quality — limited margin of safety on a pure value basis.
- **Ratings revenue is cyclical**: Credit issuance volumes decline in rising rate environments or credit market freezes, directly impressing Ratings segment revenue.
- **IHS Markit integration risk**: Mobility and parts of Market Intelligence remain in integration; execution risk persists.
- **Regulatory risk**: As an NRSRO-designated oligopoly, SPGI is a perpetual target for regulatory intervention in Washington.

## Key Risks

| Risk | Severity | Probability | Notes |
|------|----------|-------------|-------|
| Multiple contraction / macro selloff | Medium | Medium | Stock at 28x PE has more downside in a risk-off environment |
| Credit market freeze | Medium | Low | Ratings revenue tied to bond issuance volumes |
| Regulatory disruption to ratings oligopoly | High | Very Low | Attempted before; structural barriers are high |
| IHS Markit integration underdelivery | Low | Low | Synergies ahead of schedule so far |
| Competition in data/analytics (MI, Mobility) | Low | Medium | SPGI's proprietary data is the defensible layer |

## AI Disruption Assessment: VERY LOW RISK

SPGI's moat is regulatory and network-effect driven, not technological. AI is unlikely to disrupt the core franchise:

- **Credit Ratings**: Regulated by the SEC as an NRSRO. AI cannot obtain this regulatory designation. Issuers must use NRSRO-designated agencies — this is not a technological question.
- **Index Licensing**: A legal monopoly. No AI model can create or license "the S&P 500" — only S&P Global can. The moat is a trademark and a contractual web, not an algorithm.
- **Market Intelligence / Commodity Insights**: Proprietary datasets and deeply embedded workflows create switching costs. AI-enhanced competition is possible here, but SPGI is better positioned than most to deploy AI over its own data.
- **Net assessment**: AI is far more likely to enhance SPGI's products (AI-powered credit surveillance, automated analytics, smarter Platts benchmarking) than to displace the franchise. This is one of the lowest AI-disruption-risk businesses in the financial sector.
