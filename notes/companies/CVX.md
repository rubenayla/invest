# Chevron Corporation (CVX)

**Sector**: Energy (Integrated Oil & Gas)  
**Current Price**: $154.13  
**Forward P/E**: ~14.0  

## Position
- Holding: ~$1,100 (≈€1,010) as a steady dividend oil major.
- Role: Lower-risk energy ballast versus higher-beta PBR/SQM plays.

## Thesis
1. Strong balance sheet and buyback program support shareholder returns through cycles.
2. Large LNG and Permian projects provide medium-term production growth.
3. Benefits from any oil price stabilization while yielding ~4%.

## Risks
- Oil price volatility directly impacts cash flow.
- Environmental/political pressure on fossil fuels could constrain new projects.
- Acquisition/integration (e.g., Hess) execution risk.
