### Q2 FY2026 Results (Dec 2025 quarter)

| Line | Q2 FY2026 | Q2 FY2025 | YoY |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Subscription Revenue | $412.6M | $420.6M | -2% |
| Hardware Revenue | $243.9M | $253.4M | -4% |
| **Total Revenue** | **$656.5M** | **$673.9M** | **-3%** |
| Total Gross Margin | 50.5% | 47.3% | +320bps |
| Subscription Margin | 72.1% | 67.9% | +420bps |
| **Adjusted EBITDA** | **$81.4M** | **$58.4M** | **+39%** |

| Paid CF Subscribers | 2.661M | 2.875M | -7% |
| Monthly Churn (CF) | **1.9%** | 1.4% | ⚠️ +50bps |

### FY2026 Full-Year Guidance

| Metric | Guidance | Signal |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Revenue | $2,400-2,440M | ⬇️ Lowered by $71M |
| Gross Margin | ~53% | ⬆️ +210bps YoY |
| **Adjusted EBITDA** | **$450-500M** | ⬆️ Raised $25M |
| **Free Cash Flow** | **≥$275M** | ⬆️ Raised $25M |

**Key signal**: Revenue guidance CUT while EBITDA guidance RAISED = aggressive cost discipline, but top line is still shrinking.

### Interest Expense & Path to Net Profitability

**Current annual interest burden (~$120M/year):**
- Term loan: ~$985M × ~10.3% (SOFR+600bps) = ~$101M
- 5.50% converts: ~$344M × 5.5% = ~$19M

**After potential term loan refinancing (May 2026+, penalty expires):**
- If refinanced at SOFR+300bps (~7.3%): ~$72M + $19M = ~$91M/year
- **Savings: ~$29M/year** flowing straight to bottom line

**Estimated GAAP path (annualized, excluding one-time items):**
```
$475M  Adjusted EBITDA (FY26 midpoint)
-$280M  D&A + Stock-Based Compensation (~$70M/quarter)
_______
$195M  Estimated Operating Income (clean)
-$120M  Interest expense (current)
_______
 $75M  Estimated Pre-Tax Income → first net-profitable year possible

After refi: $195M - $91M = $104M pre-tax
```

### Debt Payoff Timeline

| Scenario | Annual FCF to Debt | Years to Debt-Free |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 100% FCF to debt | $275M+ | **4.8 years** (mid-2031) |
| 50% FCF to debt | ~$138M | ~9.6 years |
| Realistic (refi + partial paydown) | Mixed | **Manageable by 2031-2033** |

More likely path: refinance term loan at lower rate in mid-2026, steadily reduce principal, aim for ~1x net leverage (already there).

### Scenario Analysis (12-18 month horizon)

| Scenario | EBITDA | Multiple | EV | Equity | Per Share | vs $4.27 |
|----------|--------|----------|-----|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Bull** (revenue stabilizes + refi + re-rate) | $500M | 8x | $4.0B | $3.65B | **~$8.50** | **+99%** |
| **Base** (revenue -3%, cost discipline) | $450M | 6x | $2.7B | $2.35B | **~$5.47** | **+28%** |
| **Bear** (churn spikes, -8% rev) | $375M | 4x | $1.5B | $1.15B | **~$2.68** | **-37%** |
| **Worst** (turnaround fails, -15% rev) | $250M | 3x | $750M | $401M | **~$0.93** | **-78%** |

### Key Catalysts & Risks

**Catalysts:**
1. **Term loan refi (May/Jun 2026)** — 1% prepayment penalty expires May 2026. Management has signaled intent to optimize. Could save ~$29M/year in interest.
2. **Revenue stabilization** — Any quarter showing flat or positive revenue would trigger re-rating.
3. **Short squeeze potential** — 20% short interest with improving fundamentals. A positive surprise could force covering.
4. **EBITDA expansion** — Already beating guidance; $100M in run-rate cost savings by end of FY26.

**Risks:**
1. ⚠️ **Churn acceleration** — Monthly churn at 1.9% (was 1.4%). Price increases + competition eroding base.
2. ⚠️ **Revenue still declining** — -3% YoY with no clear inflection point. Guidance lowered.
3. ⚠️ **Hardware refresh flopped** — Cross Training Series underperformed with existing users.
4. ⚠️ **Insiders selling, not buying** — 5.1M shares sold, 0 bought in last 12 months.
5. ⚠️ **20% short interest** — Smart money is bearish. Bears see a shrinking business with heavy debt.

### 💰 Limit Buy Assessment

**What the numbers say:**
- At $4.27, PTON trades at 4.5x forward EV/EBITDA — below even turnaround-stage comps (6-10x).
- FCF yield of 15.3% is extremely attractive for any business that isn't in terminal decline.
- Median analyst target: $9.30 (+118% upside), though targets are being rapidly lowered post-Q2.
- Technical support at ~$4.00-4.20 (dating to April 2024). 52-week low: $4.09.

**The asymmetry:**
- Bull case upside: +99% to +114%
- Base case upside: +28%
- Bear case downside: -37%
- Risk/reward is favorable IF you believe revenue decline slows.

**Suggested approach (speculative, small position size):**
- **Starter position** at market (~$4.20-4.30) — you're already near the floor.
- **Larger limit buy at $3.50-3.80** — if the support at $4.00 breaks, this catches the capitulation. Would put you at ~3.8-4.2x fwd EV/EBITDA.
- **Add aggressively below $3.00** — at that level, you're paying ~3x EBITDA with cash covering most of the debt.
- **Hard stop / reassess below $2.50** — at that point, the market is pricing in turnaround failure.

**Key trigger to wait for:** If you want to de-risk, wait for the May/June 2026 term loan refinancing announcement. A successful refi at a meaningfully lower rate would confirm the deleveraging thesis and likely trigger a rally.

⚠️ **Position sizing is everything.** This is still a binary/turnaround bet. Keep it to a size where a -50% drawdown doesn't hurt your portfolio.

### Why the Stock Dropped 28% in Feb 2026

The cliff on Feb 5 was the Q2 FY2026 earnings release ($5.80 → $4.30 intraday):
1. **Revenue missed their own guidance** — $656.5M came in $8M below the low end of $665-685M range. Cross Training hardware launch flopped with existing members.
2. **Forward revenue guidance slashed** — Full-year cut by $71M. Q3 guide of $605-625M well below Street's $638M.
3. **Subscriber churn jumped** — 1.9% monthly (was 1.4%). Paid CF subs -7% YoY. Price increases pushing people away.
4. Continued drift post-earnings from analyst downgrades (Goldman $12.50→$7, JPM $9→$6) and 20% short interest pressure.

Irony: EBITDA actually *beat* expectations ($81.4M vs $73M consensus) and they *raised* EBITDA + FCF guidance. Market cared more about the shrinking top line.

### At-Home Fitness Market Trend (Is the Decline Structural or COVID Hangover?)

**Actual consumer spending data (Earnest Analytics, credit card data):**

| Period | At-Home Fitness Spending YoY |
|--------|------------------------------|
| 2021→2022 | Declining |
| 2022→2023 | **-12.5%** |
| 2023→2024 | **-9.2%** |

- 3+ consecutive years of decline
- At-home fitness = only **16% of total fitness spending** in 2024
- Earnest attributes this to "digesting the strong pull-forward effect of the pandemic" — people who bought equipment in 2020-21 don't need to replace it (long product lifecycle)
- Rate of decline IS decelerating (-12.5% → -9.2%), suggesting eventual stabilization

**Why is spending declining if the market "grew" during COVID?** It really grew — PTON revenue went $915M → $1.8B → $4.0B in two years (actual sales, not expectations). But hardware is a one-time purchase with a 5-10 year lifecycle. Millions of people who *would have* bought a Peloton in 2022-2026 bought one in 2020-21 instead ("pull-forward demand"). Those people already have their bike → no new purchase → market shrinks. Eventually those bikes wear out + new consumers enter → growth resumes. This is also why subscription revenue declines much slower (-2%) than hardware (-4%) — subscriptions are recurring and didn't get pulled forward the same way.

**Market research firms** (Fortune Business Insights, Straits Research) project 6-8% CAGR growth going forward, but these are projections — actual spending hasn't stabilized yet.

**Pre-COVID trendline comparison (PTON-specific):**
```
              Estimated Pre-COVID       What Actually
              Trendline (deceleration)  Happened
FY2019:       $915M                     $915M
FY2020:       ~$1,200M                  $1,826M  ← COVID pull-forward
FY2021:       ~$1,500M                  $4,022M  ← peak insanity
FY2022:       ~$1,800M                  $3,582M  ← hangover begins
FY2023:       ~$2,100M                  $2,800M  ← deflating
FY2024:       ~$2,300M                  $2,700M  ← converging
FY2025:       ~$2,500M                  $2,491M  ← roughly ON trendline
FY2026E:      ~$2,600M                  $2,420M  ← slightly below
```

PTON's revenue is roughly where it would have been without COVID (assuming natural growth deceleration from 100% → 30% → 20% → 15% → 10%). The pandemic pulled 2-3 years of demand forward, they overbuilt for it, and spent 3 years reverting to the natural trendline.

**Bottom line:** The at-home fitness market IS shrinking, but the decline is decelerating. This looks like a COVID normalization, not a structural death. The question is when it bottoms — could be 2025-2026 based on the deceleration trend. If PTON can hold revenue near the pre-COVID trendline (~$2.4-2.5B), current valuation at 4.5x EV/EBITDA is pricing in much worse.

### Valuation If Pre-COVID Growth Trend Resumes

**Assumption:** at-home fitness market normalizes and resumes its pre-COVID growth trajectory (~6-8% annual). PTON was growing 100%/yr pre-COVID but that naturally decelerates at scale. With operating leverage on growing revenue (fixed costs don't scale proportionally, 72% subscription gross margin, $100M cost savings, ~$29M/yr interest savings from term loan refi), EBITDA margins expand.

**Projected financials:**
```
                    Revenue    EBITDA     EBITDA    Net Debt    Cumulative
                               Margin              (Cash)      FCF from today
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
FY2026 (current)    $2.42B     $475M     19.6%     $349M         —
FY2027 (+8%)        $2.61B     $548M     21.0%     ~$50M       ~$300M
FY2028 (+7%)        $2.80B     $644M     23.0%    (~$250M)     ~$600M
FY2029 (+6%)        $2.96B     $740M     25.0%    (~$550M)     ~$900M
```

Net debt turns **negative** (net cash) by FY2028 as FCF accumulates faster than debt matures.

**Valuation scenarios by EV/EBITDA multiple re-rating:**

The multiple should re-rate as growth is proven. A shrinking business gets 4-5x. A growing subscription business with 50%+ gross margins gets 10-14x.

Conservative (8x — "turnaround proven"):

| Year | EBITDA | EV | Equity | Per Share | vs $4.27 |
|------|--------|-----|--------|-----------|----------|
| FY2027 | $548M | $4.4B | $4.3B | **$10.10** | **+137%** |
| FY2028 | $644M | $5.2B | $5.4B | **$12.60** | **+195%** |
| FY2029 | $740M | $5.9B | $6.5B | **$15.10** | **+254%** |

Mid-range (10x — "stable growth, subscription premium"):

| Year | EBITDA | EV | Equity | Per Share | vs $4.27 |
|------|--------|-----|--------|-----------|----------|
| FY2027 | $548M | $5.5B | $5.4B | **$12.60** | **+195%** |
| FY2028 | $644M | $6.4B | $6.7B | **$15.50** | **+263%** |
| FY2029 | $740M | $7.4B | $8.0B | **$18.50** | **+333%** |

Aggressive (12x — "Planet Fitness-lite"):

| Year | EBITDA | EV | Equity | Per Share | vs $4.27 |
|------|--------|-----|--------|-----------|----------|
| FY2028 | $644M | $7.7B | $8.0B | **$18.50** | **+333%** |
| FY2029 | $740M | $8.9B | $9.4B | **$21.90** | **+413%** |

**The entire bet collapses to one question: does revenue start growing again?**
- If yes → buying at 4.5x what becomes a 10-12x business = 3-5x return in 3 years
- If no → stuck at 4-5x a shrinking EBITDA = dead money or worse

The pre-COVID trendline suggests revenue *should* be ~$2.5-2.7B and growing. Current $2.42B is slightly below, meaning even modest growth gets to very attractive valuations.

### Competitive Landscape & Long-Term Moat Analysis

**Connected fitness competitors are dying:**

| Competitor | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Mirror (Lululemon) | Written off ($443M impairment), discontinued |
| Tonal | Massive layoffs, struggling |
| iFit/NordicTrack | Near-bankruptcy |
| Hydrow | <2% market share |
| BowFlex | <2% market share |

PTON has **51% share** of at-home fitness spending (up from 49% two years ago). It's the last one standing. But it's **king of a shrinking kingdom** — the real competition isn't other connected fitness, it's:
- **The $25/month gym** (Planet Fitness is booming post-COVID, memberships at 77M in 2024 vs 64M in 2019)
- **Apple Fitness+** ($10/month, no hardware, already on every iPhone)
- **Free YouTube/Instagram workouts**

**Trump / MAHA tailwind — weak for PTON:** The "Make America Healthy Again" push (RFK Jr. at HHS) focuses on food quality, chronic disease, nutrition — not fitness equipment. A vague cultural wellness tailwind at best, nothing that directly moves PTON revenue.

**AI integration — real but not a moat:** Peloton's AI coaching (personalized plans, form correction) is a genuine product improvement, but Q2 proved existing users don't care enough to upgrade for it. AI fitness coaching is easily replicable — any app with an LLM can offer it. The tight hardware+software integration *could* be an Apple-like moat, but fitness is too niche and commoditized for lock-in to work the way it does in phones. A generic AI coach on your phone works with any equipment or none at all.

**The real moat** isn't AI — it's the content library, instructor community, and social/leaderboard features. That's what keeps people paying $44/month. Whether that's defensible long-term is the core question.

### Commercial / B2B Gym Expansion — Can It Work?

PTON merged Precor (commercial subsidiary, acquired 2021) with Peloton for Business into a single commercial unit targeting hotels, corporate gyms, and fitness centers.

**The problem: PTON's costs are still ~2x too high for commercial equipment margins.**

| Metric | PTON (Q2 FY2026) | Technogym (peer) | Needed for B2B |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| G&A % of revenue | 15.7% | ~8-10% | <12% |
| S&M % of revenue | 23.2% | ~10-12% | <15% |
| Hardware gross margin | 13.9% | ~40-45% | Much higher |

Commercial is a low-margin, relationship-driven, bulk-pricing business. Gyms negotiate hard, don't pay $44/month per user, and expect maintenance contracts. Technogym and Life Fitness are entrenched with decades of relationships.

**The hope:** sell hardware to gyms at thin margins, monetize through a commercial subscription platform (content, analytics, member engagement). The 72% subscription margin subsidizes the hardware entry. But subscription revenue is *shrinking*, so the cash cow funding this expansion is getting smaller. Unproven in B2B context so far.

## 🚨 Previous Strategic Analysis: Feb 2026 (The "Turnaround" Bet)

**The "Strategic Reality" (Why it might be a Buy):**
The investment thesis is entirely dependent on the new CEO's "Cardio Plus Strength" pivot working.

1.  **The New Narrative (CEO Peter Stern, Jan 2025):**
    - Moving away from just "bikes" to a broader "wellness platform."
    - **"Cardio Plus Strength":** Attempting to capture the strength training market (larger TAM) and integrate AI coaching.
    - **Commercial Push:** New unit combining Precor and Peloton for Business to attack hotels/gyms.

2.  **The "Crash" (Why it dropped 20-25% recently):**
    - Q2 2026 earnings missed expectations.
    - **Hardware Flop:** The new AI-powered hardware refresh (Cross Training series) had a lukewarm reception. Existing users aren't upgrading.
    - **Churn:** Price increases caused a 7% drop in paid subscribers.

3.  **The Turnaround Math:**
    - **Cost Cutting:** Aiming for $100M+ in savings to hit positive EBITDA.
    - **Leverage:** If they stabilize revenue, the high-margin subscription business (software margins) creates massive operating leverage.
    - **Binary Outcome:** This is not a "safe" value stock. It is a binary option.
        - **Scenario A:** Stern fixes the cost structure → Stock is a multi-bagger from $4.
        - **Scenario B:** Debt and cash burn consume them → Bankruptcy/Restructuring.

**Verdict:**
- **Avoid** if you want safe compounding.
- **Speculative Buy** only if you believe in the "Cardio + Strength" strategic pivot and accept the risk of total loss.

## ⚠️ Legacy Thesis (Nov 2025): AVOID

**Never been profitable in 13 years of existence.**

This is NOT a "reinvesting profits" story like Amazon or Tesla.
This is a **structural cost problem** company.

## The Core Problem: Bloated Operating Expenses

### Per $100 of Revenue (FY2025):
```
$100.00  Revenue
-$49.08  Cost of Goods Sold (bikes/treadmills)
________
 $50.92  Gross Profit (51% margin - actually good!)

 -$9.40  R&D (reasonable)
-$16.23  Sales & Marketing ← PROBLEM #1 (2-3x normal)
-$20.46  G&A (overhead)    ← PROBLEM #2 (3-4x normal)
________
  $2.48  Operating Income (barely profitable)

 -$5.40  Interest on debt from loss years
________
 -$4.77  Net Loss
```

### What's Eating Their Money:

**Sales & Marketing (16% of revenue):**
- Celebrity instructor salaries (Cody Rigsby, Ally Love, etc.)
- TV commercials and influencer partnerships
- Retail showrooms in expensive malls
- Very high customer acquisition cost

**General & Administrative (21% of revenue!):**
- Built for COVID-era scale (10,000 employees at peak)
- NYC headquarters (expensive real estate)
- Production studios for filming classes
- Complex logistics (deliver/install heavy equipment)
- Product recalls, warranty claims, lawsuits

**Normal companies: G&A = 5-12% of revenue**
**Apple: 6% | Amazon: 2% | Peloton: 21%** 🚩

## Complete Earnings History (2017-2025)

### Pre-COVID Years (Never Profitable):

| Fiscal Year | Revenue | Gross Margin | Net Income | Status |
|-------------|---------|--------------|------------|--------|
| **FY2017** | $219M | ~40% | **-$71M** | LOSS |
| **FY2018** | $435M | ~40% | **-$48M** | LOSS |
| **FY2019** | $915M | 42% | **-$196M** | LOSS (widening!) |

**FY2019 Analysis:**
- Gross profit: $384M (42% margin)
- Operating expenses: $580M (63% of revenue!)
- Result: Lost $196M despite $915M in sales
- **Operating margin: -21%** (never operationally profitable)

### Post-IPO Years:

| Fiscal Year | Revenue | Gross Margin | Operating Income | Net Income | Status |
|-------------|---------|--------------|------------------|------------|--------|
| **FY2022** | $3,582M | 19.5% | **-$1,981M** | **-$2,828M** | DISASTER |
| **FY2023** | $2,800M | 33.0% | **-$863M** | **-$1,262M** | Still bleeding |
| **FY2024** | $2,700M | 44.7% | **-$406M** | **-$552M** | Improving |
| **FY2025** | $2,491M | 50.9% | **+$62M** | **-$119M** | First op. profit! |

### Quarterly Progress:
- **Q2 2025 (June 2025):** +$21.6M net profit **(FIRST PROFITABLE QUARTER EVER)**
- All other quarters since IPO: Losses

## The Death Spiral (FY2022-2025)

```
FY2022: $3.6B revenue, $1.9B SG&A → Lost $2.8B
FY2023: $2.8B revenue, $1.4B SG&A → Lost $1.3B (cut costs, revenue fell 22%)
FY2024: $2.7B revenue, $1.3B SG&A → Lost $552M  (more cuts)
FY2025: $2.5B revenue, $914M SG&A → Lost $119M  (cut 52% of SG&A!)
```

**They're shrinking to profitability, not growing to it.**

## The Catch-22

- **Cut marketing** → Revenue drops (already -30% from peak)
- **Cut G&A** → Service quality suffers → customers churn
- **Raise subscription prices** → More churn
- **Grow revenue** → Need to spend on marketing → back to losses

## Why This Isn't Like Amazon/Tesla

**Amazon/Tesla Model:**
- ✅ Gross Profit: 30-40%
- ✅ Operating Profit: Positive (small but positive)
- ❌ Net Income: Negative due to REINVESTMENT in growth
- **They CHOSE to run losses by reinvesting operating profits**

**Peloton Reality:**
- ✅ Gross Profit: 42-51% (actually good!)
- ❌ Operating Profit: Negative until FY2025
- ❌ Net Income: Never positive (annual)
- **No profits to reinvest - just structural bloat**

## Current Situation (FY2025)

**Progress Made:**
- First operating profit ever: +$62M
- Cut SG&A from $1.9B to $914M (-52%)
- Improved gross margin to 51%
- First profitable quarter (Q2 2025)

**Problems Remaining:**
- Revenue declining: $3.6B → $2.5B (-30%)
- Still net loss: -$119M
- Interest expense: $135M/year (debt from loss years)
- High churn risk if they cut more

## Valuation

**Can't calculate traditional PE ratio** (net income still negative)

**Price/Operating Earnings:**
- Market cap: $3.03B
- Operating income: $62M
- **P/Operating Earnings: 49x** (expensive!)

**Price/Free Cash Flow:** Would need to check latest FCF

## Comparison to Pre-COVID (FY2019)

**FY2019 (Pre-COVID baseline):**
- Revenue: $915M
- Gross Margin: 42%
- Operating Margin: -21%
- Net Margin: -21%
- OpEx: 63% of revenue

**FY2025 (Current):**
- Revenue: $2,491M (+172%)
- Gross Margin: 51% (+9pp)
- Operating Margin: +2.5% (+23pp improvement!)
- Net Margin: -5%
- OpEx: 48% of revenue (-15pp)

**Verdict:** Massive operational improvement, but still fragile.

## Decision

⛔ **AVOID** - Turnaround too uncertain

**Reasons to avoid:**
1. Never been profitable in 13 years
2. Revenue declining while cutting to profitability
3. Structural cost disadvantage (21% G&A ratio)
4. Highly competitive market (gyms, Zwift, cheaper alternatives)
5. One profitable quarter doesn't make a trend
6. Trading at 49x operating earnings despite shrinking revenue

**Only consider if:**
- Stock drops below $4-5 (50% downside from here)
- Show 3+ consecutive profitable quarters
- Revenue stabilizes or grows while maintaining profitability
- Evidence they can grow without ballooning costs again

## Red Flags

🚩 G&A at 21% of revenue (should be 5-12%)
🚩 Marketing at 16% of revenue (should be 8-12% for hardware)
🚩 Revenue peak was $3.6B in FY2022, now $2.5B (-30%)
🚩 13 years old, never had a profitable year
🚩 First profitable quarter only in June 2025
🚩 Built for $10B in revenue, only doing $2.5B

**Takeaway:** mildly negative/cautious signal. No insider open-market buys, steady selling. Many trades are routine (options/awards), so the signal is weak but still not bullish. Note that insiders were selling at $6-7 — now at $4.27, the selling may have stopped (TBD next filing window).
