# Peloton Interactive Inc. (PTON)

**Sector**: Consumer Cyclical (Fitness Equipment & Subscriptions)
**Current Price**: ~$4.62 (Feb 2026)
**Market Cap**: Distressed / Turnaround Play
**Position**: Watchlist / Turnaround Speculation

## 🚨 Strategic Analysis: Feb 2026 (The "Turnaround" Bet)

**The "Dumb" DCF View:** **Sell / Zero Value**
- A standard financial model hates this company. It sees negative free cash flow, declining revenue (-3% YoY), and a heavy debt load.
- If you project current trends, the equity value is zero.

**The "Strategic Reality" (Why it might be a Buy):**
The investment thesis is entirely dependent on the new CEO's "Cardio Plus Strength" pivot working.

1.  **The New Narrative (CEO Peter Stern, Jan 2025):**
    - Moving away from just "bikes" to a broader "wellness platform."
    - **"Cardio Plus Strength":** Attempting to capture the strength training market (larger TAM) and integrate AI coaching.
    - **Commercial Push:** New unit combining Precor and Peloton for Business to attack hotels/gyms.

2.  **The "Crash" (Why it dropped 20-25% recently):**
    - Q2 2026 earnings missed expectations.
    - **Hardware Flop:** The new AI-powered hardware refresh (Cross Training series) had a lukewarm reception. Existing users aren't upgrading.
    - **Churn:** Price increases caused a 7% drop in paid subscribers.

3.  **The Turnaround Math:**
    - **Cost Cutting:** Aiming for $100M+ in savings to hit positive EBITDA.
    - **Leverage:** If they stabilize revenue, the high-margin subscription business (software margins) creates massive operating leverage.
    - **Binary Outcome:** This is not a "safe" value stock. It is a binary option.
        - **Scenario A:** Stern fixes the cost structure → Stock is a multi-bagger from $4.
        - **Scenario B:** Debt and cash burn consume them → Bankruptcy/Restructuring.

**Verdict:**
- **Avoid** if you want safe compounding.
- **Speculative Buy** only if you believe in the "Cardio + Strength" strategic pivot and accept the risk of total loss.

## ⚠️ Legacy Thesis (Nov 2025): AVOID

**Never been profitable in 13 years of existence.**

This is NOT a "reinvesting profits" story like Amazon or Tesla.
This is a **structural cost problem** company.

## The Core Problem: Bloated Operating Expenses

### Per $100 of Revenue (FY2025):
```
$100.00  Revenue
-$49.08  Cost of Goods Sold (bikes/treadmills)
________
 $50.92  Gross Profit (51% margin - actually good!)

 -$9.40  R&D (reasonable)
-$16.23  Sales & Marketing ← PROBLEM #1 (2-3x normal)
-$20.46  G&A (overhead)    ← PROBLEM #2 (3-4x normal)
________
  $2.48  Operating Income (barely profitable)

 -$5.40  Interest on debt from loss years
________
 -$4.77  Net Loss
```

### What's Eating Their Money:

**Sales & Marketing (16% of revenue):**
- Celebrity instructor salaries (Cody Rigsby, Ally Love, etc.)
- TV commercials and influencer partnerships
- Retail showrooms in expensive malls
- Very high customer acquisition cost

**General & Administrative (21% of revenue!):**
- Built for COVID-era scale (10,000 employees at peak)
- NYC headquarters (expensive real estate)
- Production studios for filming classes
- Complex logistics (deliver/install heavy equipment)
- Product recalls, warranty claims, lawsuits

**Normal companies: G&A = 5-12% of revenue**
**Apple: 6% | Amazon: 2% | Peloton: 21%** 🚩

## Complete Earnings History (2017-2025)

### Pre-COVID Years (Never Profitable):

| Fiscal Year | Revenue | Gross Margin | Net Income | Status |
|-------------|---------|--------------|------------|--------|
| **FY2017** | $219M | ~40% | **-$71M** | LOSS |
| **FY2018** | $435M | ~40% | **-$48M** | LOSS |
| **FY2019** | $915M | 42% | **-$196M** | LOSS (widening!) |

**FY2019 Analysis:**
- Gross profit: $384M (42% margin)
- Operating expenses: $580M (63% of revenue!)
- Result: Lost $196M despite $915M in sales
- **Operating margin: -21%** (never operationally profitable)

### Post-IPO Years:

| Fiscal Year | Revenue | Gross Margin | Operating Income | Net Income | Status |
|-------------|---------|--------------|------------------|------------|--------|
| **FY2022** | $3,582M | 19.5% | **-$1,981M** | **-$2,828M** | DISASTER |
| **FY2023** | $2,800M | 33.0% | **-$863M** | **-$1,262M** | Still bleeding |
| **FY2024** | $2,700M | 44.7% | **-$406M** | **-$552M** | Improving |
| **FY2025** | $2,491M | 50.9% | **+$62M** | **-$119M** | First op. profit! |

### Quarterly Progress:
- **Q2 2025 (June 2025):** +$21.6M net profit **(FIRST PROFITABLE QUARTER EVER)**
- All other quarters since IPO: Losses

## The Death Spiral (FY2022-2025)

```
FY2022: $3.6B revenue, $1.9B SG&A → Lost $2.8B
FY2023: $2.8B revenue, $1.4B SG&A → Lost $1.3B (cut costs, revenue fell 22%)
FY2024: $2.7B revenue, $1.3B SG&A → Lost $552M  (more cuts)
FY2025: $2.5B revenue, $914M SG&A → Lost $119M  (cut 52% of SG&A!)
```

**They're shrinking to profitability, not growing to it.**

## The Catch-22

- **Cut marketing** → Revenue drops (already -30% from peak)
- **Cut G&A** → Service quality suffers → customers churn
- **Raise subscription prices** → More churn
- **Grow revenue** → Need to spend on marketing → back to losses

## Why This Isn't Like Amazon/Tesla

**Amazon/Tesla Model:**
- ✅ Gross Profit: 30-40%
- ✅ Operating Profit: Positive (small but positive)
- ❌ Net Income: Negative due to REINVESTMENT in growth
- **They CHOSE to run losses by reinvesting operating profits**

**Peloton Reality:**
- ✅ Gross Profit: 42-51% (actually good!)
- ❌ Operating Profit: Negative until FY2025
- ❌ Net Income: Never positive (annual)
- **No profits to reinvest - just structural bloat**

## Current Situation (FY2025)

**Progress Made:**
- First operating profit ever: +$62M
- Cut SG&A from $1.9B to $914M (-52%)
- Improved gross margin to 51%
- First profitable quarter (Q2 2025)

**Problems Remaining:**
- Revenue declining: $3.6B → $2.5B (-30%)
- Still net loss: -$119M
- Interest expense: $135M/year (debt from loss years)
- High churn risk if they cut more

## Valuation

**Can't calculate traditional PE ratio** (net income still negative)

**Price/Operating Earnings:**
- Market cap: $3.03B
- Operating income: $62M
- **P/Operating Earnings: 49x** (expensive!)

**Price/Free Cash Flow:** Would need to check latest FCF

## Comparison to Pre-COVID (FY2019)

**FY2019 (Pre-COVID baseline):**
- Revenue: $915M
- Gross Margin: 42%
- Operating Margin: -21%
- Net Margin: -21%
- OpEx: 63% of revenue

**FY2025 (Current):**
- Revenue: $2,491M (+172%)
- Gross Margin: 51% (+9pp)
- Operating Margin: +2.5% (+23pp improvement!)
- Net Margin: -5%
- OpEx: 48% of revenue (-15pp)

**Verdict:** Massive operational improvement, but still fragile.

## Decision

⛔ **AVOID** - Turnaround too uncertain

**Reasons to avoid:**
1. Never been profitable in 13 years
2. Revenue declining while cutting to profitability
3. Structural cost disadvantage (21% G&A ratio)
4. Highly competitive market (gyms, Zwift, cheaper alternatives)
5. One profitable quarter doesn't make a trend
6. Trading at 49x operating earnings despite shrinking revenue

**Only consider if:**
- Stock drops below $4-5 (50% downside from here)
- Show 3+ consecutive profitable quarters
- Revenue stabilizes or grows while maintaining profitability
- Evidence they can grow without ballooning costs again

## Red Flags

🚩 G&A at 21% of revenue (should be 5-12%)
🚩 Marketing at 16% of revenue (should be 8-12% for hardware)
🚩 Revenue peak was $3.6B in FY2022, now $2.5B (-30%)
🚩 13 years old, never had a profitable year
🚩 First profitable quarter only in June 2025
🚩 Built for $10B in revenue, only doing $2.5B
