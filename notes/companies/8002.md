# Marubeni Corporation (8002.T)

**Sector**: Trading Houses / Conglomerates  
**Country**: Japan 🇯🇵  
**Current Price**: ¥3,950  

## Position
- Holding: ¥447,000 (≈€2,770) long-term stake for commodity/infrastructure exposure.
- Role: Diversifies USD-heavy holdings with yen assets and dividend income.

## Thesis
1. Trading houses benefit from Japan’s push for energy/security deals plus weak yen tailwind.
2. Marubeni’s ROE has stayed above 15% thanks to disciplined capital allocation.
3. Buffett/BRK stake provides signaling effect and lowers downside volatility.

## Risks
- Commodity cycle downturn would hit earnings sharply.
- Yen strength would reduce translation benefits for EUR/USD investors.
- Corporate governance reforms could slow, limiting valuation multiple expansion.
