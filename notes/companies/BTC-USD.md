# Bitcoin (BTC-USD)

**Asset Class**: Cryptocurrency / Digital Gold
**Verdict**: **Macro/Liquidity Play**

## 🚨 Strategic Analysis: Feb 2026 (The Cycle Low?)

**The "Dumb" DCF View:** **N/A**
- Bitcoin has no cash flows, so it cannot be valued by DCF.

**The "Strategic Reality" (Cycle Timing):**
1.  **The 4-Year Cycle:**
    - Many analysts project late 2026 as a potential "bear market bottom" or cyclical low, following the 2024/2025 halving cycle.
    - **Risk:** If history repeats, 2026 could be a year of downtrend or consolidation.

2.  **The New Drivers:**
    - **ETFs:** Institutional flows now dominate. BTC correlates more with global liquidity (M2 money supply) and risk-on sentiment (Fed rates).
    - **Scenario:** If the Fed cuts rates and liquidity expands, BTC rallies regardless of the "cycle." If we hit a recession, it dumps with tech stocks.

**Verdict:**
- **Accumulate** only if you have a 5+ year horizon.
- **Don't trade the noise:** Focus on global liquidity conditions, not day-to-day headlines.
