# Otsuka Holdings (4578.T)

**Sector**: Pharmaceutical
**Current Price**: ~¥9,344 (Feb 2026)
**Verdict**: **Hold / Wait for Pipeline Proof**

## 🚨 Strategic Analysis: Feb 2026 (The Patent Cliff)

**The "Dumb" DCF View:** **Hold/Overvalued**
- Current cash flows look okay, but the price seems high relative to growth.

**The "Strategic Reality" (The imminent threat):**
1.  **The Patent Cliff (2025):**
    - **The Threat:** Their blockbuster antipsychotic drug, *Abilify Maintena* ($15.5B sales in 2022), loses patent protection in March/June 2025.
    - **Impact:** Cheap generics will flood the market, crushing this revenue stream. This is why the stock has struggled or traded sideways.

2.  **The Defense (Pipeline):**
    - **New Drugs:** They are banking on a new Alzheimer's drug and a pipeline of 12 Phase III compounds to fill the revenue hole.
    - **Diversification:** *Rexulti* and *JINARC* are growing, but are they enough to replace *Abilify*?

**Verdict:**
- The market hates uncertainty. Until the pipeline drugs prove they can replace the lost *Abilify* revenue, the stock will be dead money.
- **Watch List:** Revisit in late 2026 if the new drug launches succeed.
