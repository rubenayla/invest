## Thesis

Paychex is a capital-light compounder with 40.9% ROE and 41.7% operating margins, currently trading 42% off its highs — the deepest pullback among high-conviction picks. A cluster of director buys near $98-99 (now underwater) signals insiders believe the selloff is overdone. The core payroll infrastructure business has durable switching costs and regulatory moats that AI cannot easily replicate.

---

## Business Model

Paychex serves ~750K+ small and mid-sized business clients with:

- **Payroll processing**: tax filing with 50 state agencies + IRS, direct deposit, W-2 preparation (~12M W-2s/year). Paychex is a registered payroll agent, legally liable for accurate withholding and filing.
- **HR solutions**: benefits administration, workers' comp, 401k/retirement plan management.
- **HCM software (Paychex Flex)**: time & attendance, hiring, onboarding.

Revenue is highly recurring (monthly per-employee fees). Switching costs are procedural and painful — migrating payroll means re-registering tax accounts in every jurisdiction, re-verifying bank details for every employee, and re-enrolling benefits (3-6 month process). The company also earns **float income** on payroll funds held between client collection and employee disbursement, which benefits from higher interest rates.

Competes with ADP (larger, enterprise-focused) and Gusto (smaller, pure SMB). Paychex sits in the sweet spot: too large for Gusto, less complex than ADP enterprise.

## Fundamentals

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P/E | 20.6 |
| P/B | 8.4 |
| Current Ratio | 1.3 |
| ROE | 40.9% |
| D/E | 1.3 |
| Operating Margin | 41.7% |
| Profit Margin | 26.4% |
| Revenue Growth (YoY) | 18.3% |
| Earnings Growth (YoY) | -3.5% |

High P/B (8.4) reflects the asset-light, high-ROIC nature of the business. The 41.7% operating margin is software-like economics on a services business. Earnings declining 3.5% YoY is the key concern.

## Insider Activity (180d)

| Name | Role | Action | Amount | Price | Shares Owned |
|------|------|--------|--------|-------|--------------|
| Tom Bonadio | Director | Buy | $98,500 | $98.50 | 21,504 |
| Joseph Doody | Director | Buy | $98,800 | $98.76 | 1,000 (new) |

- 2 buys / 0 sells | Cluster of 2 | ~19 days ago | 100% net buying
- Both directors are currently underwater (bought ~$98-99, stock now at $91)
- Doody opened a new position — no prior exposure, deliberate initiation

The underwater status makes this more credible, not less — they had no "exit near cost" motive. Insiders buying a 42% drawdown in a quality business is a textbook contrarian signal.

## Valuation

| Model | Price Target | Upside |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Residual Income Model (RIM) | $163 | +78.5% |
| GBM Lite 3y | $157 | +71.6% |
| GBM Optimistic 3y | $112 | +22.2% |
| GBM Base 3y | $110 | +20.1% |
| GBM Optimistic 1y | $109 | +19.7% |

**Opportunity Score**: 50.6 (Quality=80.8, Value=34.0, Growth=33.6, Risk=51.9, Catalyst=55.5)

The wide spread between base ($110) and RIM ($163) reflects uncertainty on growth normalization. Even the conservative base case implies 20% upside. The high quality score (80.8) reflects the operating margin and ROE profile.

---

## Bull Case

- Textbook contrarian setup: directors buying a 42% drawdown in a 41% ROE business, now underwater
- Payroll/HR SaaS has recurring revenue with structural switching costs and regulatory moat
- Float income is a free option on rates — immune to AI
- Capital-light model; 41.7% operating margins are durable, not cyclical
- P/E of 20.6 is reasonable for a quality compounder at this margin/ROE profile
- RIM and GBM Lite targets suggest 70-79% upside to fair value

## Bear Case

- Earnings declining 3.5% YoY — the most important near-term red flag
- Revenue growth of 18.3% may include Paychex Flex one-time tailwind that doesn't recur
- SMB employment is cyclically sensitive — a recession shrinks per-client revenue as businesses cut headcount
- P/B of 8.4 leaves limited margin of safety if multiples compress
- The 42% drawdown may reflect a genuine deterioration in the SMB demand environment, not just sentiment

---

## Key Risks

1. **SMB hiring slowdown**: Revenue is per-employee — if SMB clients reduce headcount, revenue falls without client churn. This is the biggest macro risk.
2. **Rate cuts**: Float income declines as rates fall. This has been a tailwind since 2022 and could reverse.
3. **Earnings trajectory**: -3.5% EPS growth needs to stabilize and reverse for re-rating to occur.
4. **Competition at the low end**: Gusto and newer entrants compete aggressively for simple payroll; if Paychex loses net new clients, growth stalls.
5. **Valuation compression**: P/B of 8.4 could compress further if earnings don't recover.

## AI Disruption Assessment: LOW

Payroll is regulated, liability-heavy infrastructure — closer to financial plumbing than software.

**Why AI cannot easily disrupt the core:**

- **Regulatory compliance is the moat, not the software.** Payroll means filing with 50 state tax agencies, the IRS, and thousands of local jurisdictions — each with different rules that change constantly. Paychex handles ~12M W-2s/year.
- **Paychex is a registered payroll agent with legal liability.** If they mess up withholding or filing, they pay the penalties. No CFO is handing that liability to an AI wrapper.
- **Float income is untouched by AI.** The billions in client funds held between collection and disbursement are a structural feature of the business model.
- **Switching costs are procedural, not technical.** Migration means re-registering tax accounts in every jurisdiction, re-verifying bank details for every employee, re-enrolling benefits — a 3-6 month operational headache regardless of technology.

**Where AI could pressure the business:**

- Simpler HR features (onboarding, job postings, basic compliance Q&A) could face competition from AI-native tools, eroding software ARPU.
- If AI dramatically reduces SMB headcount at client companies, per-employee revenue falls — indirect effect.
- Gusto or new entrants could use AI to undercut on price for the simplest payroll cases, competing for net new small clients.

**Net**: AI disruption risk to core payroll is low. The bigger risk is macro — SMB employment trends. The 42% drawdown already prices in significant pessimism for a business with 41% ROE and near-zero churn in its core product.
