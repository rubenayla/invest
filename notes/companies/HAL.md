## Investment Case

### Why Halliburton?

1. **Oil Services Leader**
   - One of "Big 3" (HAL, SLB, BKR)
   - Global footprint, diversified services
   - Technology leader in fracking, drilling

2. **Benefits from Oil Recovery**
   - Oil at $81 supports drilling activity
   - E&P companies increasing capex
   - Services pricing improving

3. **US-Based = Lower Risk**
   - No political risk (vs PBR)
   - No currency risk
   - Stable regulatory environment

4. **Reasonable Valuation**
   - Forward PE 8.3 (cheap for quality)
   - 7 out of 12 models bullish
   - Not stretched like pure E&P plays

### Business Model

**Oil field services company** - doesn't own oil/gas reserves:
- Drilling services (bits, rigs, directional drilling)
- Completion services (fracking, cementing)
- Production optimization
- Digital solutions

**Advantage**: Asset-light, recurring revenue from services

**Disadvantage**: Cyclical based on E&P capex spending

## Comparison to Other Energy Stocks

| Stock | Upside | PE | Risk | Type |
|-------|--------|-----|------|------|
| **HAL** | +34% | 8.3 fwd | Medium | Services |
| PBR | +280%/+18% | 5.4 | Very High | Integrated |
| SU | +61% | 12.2 | Medium | Integrated |
| APA | +38% | 7.8 | Medium-High | E&P |
| TTE | +44% | 10.1 | Medium | Integrated |

**HAL positioning**: Middle upside, reasonable risk, clean exposure

## Risks

### 1. Oil Price Sensitivity (MEDIUM)
- Revenue tied to drilling activity
- If oil drops to $60-70, E&P cuts spending
- Services pricing compressed in downturns

### 2. Cyclicality (MEDIUM-HIGH)
- Very cyclical business
- E&P capex cuts = immediate revenue hit
- Long recovery cycles

### 3. Competition (MEDIUM)
- Schlumberger (SLB) is larger
- Baker Hughes (BKR) aggressive on tech
- Regional players in shale

### 4. Energy Transition (LOW-MEDIUM)
- Long-term threat from renewables
- But oil services needed for decades
- Diversifying into carbon capture, geothermal

### 5. Debt (MEDIUM)
- 84% debt-to-equity (manageable)
- Needs to maintain cash flow for debt service

## What Could Go Right

1. **Oil stays $80-100**: Sustained drilling activity → revenue growth
2. **E&P capex recovery**: After years of underinvestment, spending increases
3. **International growth**: Middle East, Latin America expansion
4. **Technology premium**: Digital/automation commands higher pricing
5. **M&A**: Consolidation in oil services (acquirer or target)

**Potential return**: $35-40 (+30-50%) in 12-18 months

## What Could Go Wrong

1. **Oil crashes to $60**: E&P companies slash budgets → revenue down 20-30%
2. **Recession**: Industrial demand drops → oil demand drops → drilling stops
3. **Shale slowdown**: US shale production plateaus
4. **ESG pressure**: Institutional investors avoid oil services
5. **Margin compression**: Competition drives pricing down

**Potential loss**: $20-22 (-20-25%) in downturn scenario

## Investment Strategy

**Position sizing**: 5-10% of portfolio (moderate allocation)

**Entry strategy**:
- Current price $26.62: Fair entry
- Better entry: $24-25 (wait for dip)
- Great entry: <$24 (buy aggressively)

**Price targets**:
- Conservative: $32 (+20%)
- Base case: $35 (+31%)
- Bull case: $40-45 (+50-70%)

**Time horizon**: 12-18 months

**Stop loss**: $22 (-17%) to protect against oil crash
