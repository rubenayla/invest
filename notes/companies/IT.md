## Thesis
1. **Sticky subscription model** – Research contracts and renewal rates are durable even in softer budgets.
2. **Pricing power** – Premium research and advisory pricing supports solid margins.
3. **Multiple reset already happened** – Stock has repriced sharply; valuation now closer to fair value vs prior years.

## Risks
- **Guidance and growth slowdown** – Contract value growth decelerating; guidance cuts can drive further multiple compression.
- **Budget tightening** – CIO spend cuts reduce discretionary research/consulting demand.
- **AI disruption narrative** – Market may re-rate research firms due to AI-driven alternatives.

## Monitoring
- Contract value and subscription growth (leading indicator).
- Renewal rates and pricing power commentary.
- Operating margin trend (should hold >15%).
- Next earnings guidance vs prior year.
