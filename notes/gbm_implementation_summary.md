- `volume_trend`: Recent volume vs average volume

### Computed Features
- `log_market_cap`: Log-transformed market cap (handles scale)
- `fcf_yield`: Free cash flow / market cap
- `ocf_yield`: Operating cash flow / market cap
- `earnings_yield`: EPS / (market cap / book value)

## Key Insights

### Performance Comparison

**Best 1-Year Models:**
1. Full GBM 1y: Rank IC 0.6146 (best overall)
2. Lite GBM 1y: Rank IC 0.5865

**Best 3-Year Models:**
1. Lite GBM 3y: Rank IC 0.6076 (best overall!)
2. Full GBM 3y: Rank IC 0.5926

### Surprising Finding
**Lite GBM 3y outperforms Full GBM 3y** (0.6076 vs 0.5926)
- Possible reasons:
  - Lite model's simpler features generalize better over long horizons
  - Full model may overfit to short-term patterns that don't persist 3 years
  - 3-year predictions require fundamental stability > complex patterns

### Implementation Notes
1. **Fixed Random Seeds Critical**: Initial comparison showed false 10% performance difference due to random seed variation
2. **Training Bottleneck**: Loading 35M price history records takes ~17 minutes per model
3. **Feature Engineering**: 15x feature expansion (27 base â†’ 464 full, 247 lite) drives performance
4. **Cross-sectional Normalization**: Z-score normalization per date enables regime-agnostic learning

## Usage

### Running Predictions

**Full GBM Models:**
```bash
cd /Users/rubenayla/repos/invest
uv run python scripts/run_gbm_1y_predictions.py  # Predicts stocks with 12+ quarters
uv run python scripts/run_gbm_3y_predictions.py  # Predicts stocks with 12+ quarters
```

**Lite GBM Models:**
```bash
uv run python scripts/run_gbm_lite_1y_predictions.py  # Predicts remaining stocks (4-11 quarters)
uv run python scripts/run_gbm_lite_3y_predictions.py  # Predicts remaining stocks (4-11 quarters)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run Predictions**: Execute all 4 prediction scripts to populate database
2. **Regenerate Dashboard**: Run `scripts/dashboard.py`
3. **Monitor Performance**: Track Rank IC and Decile Spread over time
4. **Ensemble Opportunity**: Consider combining Full + Lite predictions for maximum coverage

## Production Recommendations

**Portfolio Construction (1-year horizon):**
- Primary: Full GBM 1y (Rank IC 0.6146, 80% decile spread)
- Backup: Lite GBM 1y for stocks with limited history

**Portfolio Construction (3-year horizon):**
- Primary: Lite GBM 3y (Rank IC 0.6076, 185% decile spread)
- Backup: Full GBM 3y for comparison

**Coverage Strategy:**
- Run Full GBM first (covers mature stocks with 12+ quarters)
- Run Lite GBM second (fills gaps for newer stocks with 4-11 quarters)
- Combined coverage: ~93% of all stocks in database
