# The Walt Disney Company (DIS)

**Sector**: Communication Services / Media  
**Current Price**: $111.65  

## Position
- Holding: ~$2,000 (≈€1,840) starter position for turnaround exposure.
- Role: Reopenings + streaming pivot; keep below 5% until margins normalize.

## Thesis
1. Cost cuts and price hikes are pushing DTC segment toward break-even by FY26.
2. Parks + cruise demand remain resilient; international expansion adds growth.
3. ESPN/Disney+ sports JV + Hulu integration could unlock bundling value.

## Risks
- Slower streaming subscriber growth or higher churn.
- Strike/production delays impacting content pipeline.
- Debt load from Fox acquisition limits capital flexibility.
