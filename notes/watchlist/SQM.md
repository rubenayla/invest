# Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile (SQM)

**Sector**: Basic Materials (Lithium & Specialty Chemicals)  
**Country**: Chile 🇨🇱  
**Current Price**: $59.49 (≈€55)  
**Market Cap**: ~$17B  
**Position**: €6.8k (existing) – evaluating trim vs. hold

## Business Mix (FY23/FY24 run-rate)

| Segment | % Revenue | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Lithium & Derivatives** | ~74% | Battery-grade Li₂CO₃/LiOH; Salar de Atacama + Mt. Holland JV |
| Iodine & Derivatives | ~11% | Medical/isotope demand |
| Specialty Plant Nutrients | ~13% | Nitrate fertilizers (Ultrasol/Qrop) |
| Industrial Chemicals & Others | <3% | Solar salts, potassium etc. |

Lithium drives >80% of EBITDA, so the stock is essentially a leveraged play on lithium pricing.

## Quick Metrics (data/stock_data.db)

- **Revenue Growth**: -19% YoY (price collapse)  
- **Earnings Growth**: -59% YoY  
- **Operating Margin**: 17.7% (was 45% in 2022)  
- **Profit Margin**: 11.3%  
- **ROE**: 9.3%  
- **Debt/Equity**: 1.78 (net debt ~$2.5B)  
- **Current Ratio**: 2.9  
- **Forward P/E**: ~15 (assumes Li₂CO₃ ≈ $18k/t)

## Catalysts & Macro Drivers

1. **Lithium Spot Recovery** – Prices bounced from <$12k/t to ~$15k/t as Chinese lepidolite miners idled. Sustained move above $18k/t would double EBITDA versus 2024 levels.  
2. **EV Demand** – BYD/Tesla/European OEM sales still up 20%+, supported by U.S./EU/China incentives.  
3. **Supply Discipline** – Delays/cuts from Chinese and Australian producers tighten the market; SQM’s brine cost base (<$5k/t) makes it one of the survivors.  
4. **Codelco Partnership (Dec 2024)** – Extends Salar de Atacama rights to 2060 under a new JV where Codelco owns 50%+1 share. SQM keeps operational control and can expand to ~300kt LCE, but state take (royalties + taxes + Codelco share) rises to 60-70% of operating profit. Guarantees access but dilutes future upside.

## Risks

- **Commodity Whipsaw**: Prices could retest marginal cost ($10-12k/t) if EV demand slows or Chinese supply restarts aggressively.  
- **State Economics**: Higher government take permanently lowers SQM’s share of profits; unexpected policy shifts could further squeeze margins.  
- **Balance Sheet**: Leverage is manageable but rising capex (~$3.5B by 2030) plus volatile cash flows limit buybacks/dividends.  
- **Global Recession**: EV unit sales are still cyclical; a U.S./EU downturn could hit 2026 earnings.  
- **Execution**: Salar Futuro + Mt. Holland ramp must deliver quality/volume without cost overruns.

## Investment View / Action Plan

- **Base Case (Hold core)**: Maintain the €6.8k position but set alerts on (a) battery-grade Li₂CO₃ > $18k/t and (b) SQM stock > $70. Use any rally to rebalance if exposure exceeds risk tolerance.  
- **Trim Case**: If lithium stalls < $15k/t through H1 2026 or Chile signals a take >70%, trim 30-50% and redeploy to higher-conviction names (ACGL, MOH, GOOGL).  
- **Full Exit Trigger**: Renewed price collapse <$12k/t, state/JV terms worsen, or leverage climbs due to required capex without cash flow recovery.

## Monitoring Checklist

1. **Weekly lithium carbonate spot** (Benchmark/Asian Metal).  
2. **Quarterly SQM guidance** – volumes, realized prices, capex.  
3. **Codelco JV final approvals** – confirm royalty/tax schedule and board structure.  
4. **Chinese EV data** – BYD/Tesla deliveries, China passenger car association stats.  
5. **Global stimulus signals** – Fed/ECB/China support measures that could buoy EV demand.

Use this note to revisit the thesis before adding or selling; SQM is the only commodity-heavy name on the watchlist, so position sizing should reflect its higher volatility and new state-partnership economics.
