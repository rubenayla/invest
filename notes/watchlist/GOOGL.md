## Valuation Snapshot (data/stock_data.db)

| Model | Fair Value | Upside |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GBM Opp 3y | $542 | +87% |
| GBM Opp 1y | $486 | +68% |
| GBM Lite 1y | $484 | +67% |
| GBM Lite 3y | $517 | +78% |
| GBM 1y | $384 | +33% |
| GBM 3y | $371 | +28% |
| RIM | $446 | +54% |
| Growth DCF | $282 | -3% |
| Classic DCFs | $166-$179 | -38% to -43% (penalize AI capex) |
| Simple Ratios | $120 | -59% |

**Takeaway**: ML/RIM favor upside from AI monetization and margin expansion, while strict cash-flow DCFs look conservative due to heavy capex and TAC assumptions.

## Thesis

1. **AI Monetization Flywheel** – Search + YouTube integrate Gemini, while Google Cloud is scaling high-margin AI services. Advertising moat plus AI platform opportunity.
2. **Shareholder Returns** – $70B+ buyback authorization supports EPS growth; potential dividend once capex moderates.
3. **Balance Sheet Strength** – Net cash protects against regulatory fines and funds AI capex; leverage is essentially zero.
4. **Cloud/Hardware Stack** – Owning TPU hardware, Android devices, and distribution gives it more optionality than pure-play AI peers.
5. **Buffett/Berkshire Buying** – Berkshire recently initiated a stake; their buying usually boosts near-term demand and lowers downside risk while they accumulate. If they start selling, the unwind could amplify drawdowns.

## Risks

- Regulatory (DOJ antitrust, EU DMA) could force product changes.  
- CAPEX intensity for AI accelerators drags free cash flow in the near term.  
- Competition from OpenAI + Microsoft for default AI assistants.  
- **Berkshire Flow Risk** – A future pause/exit from Berkshire would likely hit sentiment harder than normal given the “Buffett premium.”

## Monitoring

- Track Search ad growth vs. TAC.  
- Watch Cloud margin disclosure each quarter.  
- Rebalance if price >$500 (where Opportunistic 3y target gets hit) or if AI monetization slows.
