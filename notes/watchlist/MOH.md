# Molina Healthcare Inc. (MOH)

**Sector**: Healthcare (Managed Care)  
**Current Price**: $162.84  
**Forward P/E**: ~6.3  

## Position
- Holding: €6,000 (≈$6.5k) accumulated during the 2025 selloff.
- Role: Defensive core position; target 8-10% of portfolio for steady cash flows vs. cyclicals.

## Thesis
1. Medicaid/ACA enrollment still expanding; MOH continues to capture share.
2. ROE near 20% with net cash balance sheet allows buybacks and bolt-on deals.
3. Street punished the stock alongside CNC despite MOH’s stronger underwriting; mean reversion to $200+ offers 20-30% upside.

## Risks
- Policy/regulatory changes to premium rates.
- Medical cost trend surprises (e.g., higher utilization) hurting margins.
- Concentration in government programs keeps reimbursement risk elevated.
