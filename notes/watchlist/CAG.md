# Conagra Brands, Inc. (CAG)

## Summary
- Decision: Do not buy
- Reason: Low growth plus high leverage, with a recent large impairment driving a negative TTM P/E

## Fundamentals (FY ends May 31)
- Revenue: 2022 11.54B, 2023 12.28B, 2024 12.05B, 2025 11.61B
- Net income: 2022 0.89B, 2023 0.68B, 2024 0.35B, 2025 1.15B

## Why TTM P/E is negative
- TTM net income: about -0.098B (sum of last 4 quarters)
- Quarter 2025-11-30 net income: -0.664B
- Unusual items in that quarter:
  - Total unusual items: -0.969B
  - Special income charges: -0.969B
  - Impairment of capital assets: 0.968B
  - Tax effect of unusual items: -0.203B

## Cash flow and leverage
- TTM free cash flow: about 0.876B
- Dividend: 1.40 per share (last 4 payouts), about 1.3x covered by TTM FCF
- Total debt: 8.07B; cash: 0.07B

## Conclusion
Cheap on market cap alone, but not enough for me given flat-to-lower revenue vs FY2023 and high leverage. I will revisit if volumes stabilize, margins hold, and debt keeps trending down.
