# Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)

**Sector**: Consumer Discretionary / EVs  
**Current Price**: $460.55  
**Forward P/E**: ~142  

## Position
- Holding: ~$1,300 (≈€1,200) legacy growth stake; trimmed but still tracking optionality.
- Role: High-beta upside to robotaxi/AI narratives while capped at <3% of portfolio.

## Thesis
1. Software/robotaxi option value keeps sentiment elevated despite auto margin pressure.
2. Energy storage deployments growing triple digits, diversifying revenue.
3. Balance sheet net cash with manufacturing flexibility (Mexico, Berlin, Texas ramps).

## Risks
- Competition from BYD/legacy OEMs in mass-market EV segment.
- Margin compression if price cuts continue.
- Regulatory/auto demand hit in a recession would hurt valuation fast.
