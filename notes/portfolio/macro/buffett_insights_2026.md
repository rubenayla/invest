# Warren Buffett & Berkshire Hathaway Insights (Feb 2026)
**Relevance to Current Portfolio Strategy**

## 1. Financials & Credit Cards (Relevance: SYF)
*   **The Move:** Berkshire Hathaway **exited Synchrony Financial (SYF)** back in 2021.
*   **The Shift:** However, they aggressively bought **Capital One (COF)** in 2023-2025 and hold ~$1.5B.
*   **Takeaway:** Buffett still likes the US consumer credit thesis but preferred Capital One's valuation/model at the time. This validates the *sector* (Credit Services) even if he swapped horses.
*   **Capital One vs. Synchrony:** COF is a general-purpose lender (competing with Chase/Citi). SYF is a "private label" lender (store cards). SYF's "moat" in store cards might actually be safer against the "Capital One/Discover" merger than Capital One itself.

## 2. Japanese Equities (Relevance: SONY)
*   **The Move:** Buffett has committed to holding the 5 Japanese Trading Houses (Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Itochu, etc.) for "decades." He owns ~10% of each.
*   **The Logic:** He loves their **strong cash flows, diversification, and shareholder-friendly policies** (dividends/buybacks).
*   **Relevance to Sony:** While he doesn't own Sony directly, his massive bet on Japan validates the region's corporate governance reforms. Japanese companies (including Sony) are under pressure to stop hoarding cash and return it to shareholders—a trend Buffett is explicitly betting on.

## 3. Healthcare (Relevance: MOH)
*   **The Move:** Bought heavily into **UnitedHealth (UNH)** and holds **DaVita (DVA)**.
*   **The Logic:** He views healthcare as a defensive value play. He bought UNH when it dipped, following his classic "buy good companies when they are on the operating table" rule.
*   **Relevance to Molina:** This supports our thesis on **Molina (MOH)**. The sector was punished for regulatory fears (Medicare rates), creating a value entry point. Buffett buying the sector leader (UNH) on weakness suggests the "regulatory panic" is a buying opportunity, not a structural death sentence.

## 4. General Philosophy (2025/2026)
*   **Net Seller:** Berkshire has been a net seller of stocks (trimming Apple/Bank of America), raising cash.
*   **Interpretation:** He sees the general market as expensive. This aligns with our strategy of picking **specific deep value** stocks (MOH, SONY, SYF) rather than just buying the S&P 500 index blindly at all-time highs.
