# Investment Allocation Strategy ($5,000)
**Date:** Feb 7, 2026
**Focus:** Strategic Value & Turnarounds
**Note:** User retains existing ~$3,000 TSLA position (Hold).

## 💰 The "Aggressive Value" Barbell
Since TSLA is already a large holding, new capital is focused on **Deep Value (MOH, SONY)** and **Cash Flow (SYF)**.

| Ticker | Company | Role | Allocation % | Amount ($) | Buy Limit / Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MOH** | Molina Healthcare | **High Conviction Anchor** | 45% | **$2,250** | **Market.** Buy immediately. We are buying the "regulatory crisis" dip. |
| **SONY** | Sony Group | **Tech Value** | 35% | **$1,750** | **Split Buy.** Buy $750 at Market, set Limit for $1,000 at **$21.75**. |
| **SYF** | Synchrony Financial | **Cash Flow Machine** | 15% | **$750** | **Market.** 5x earnings valuation protects downside. |
| **BTC** | Bitcoin | **Macro Hedge** | 5% | **$250** | **Accumulate.** Buy weekly ($50/week) to average in during the 2026 cycle. |
| **TSLA** | Tesla | *(Existing Position)* | 0% | -- | **Hold.** Do not add. Rely on existing $3k stake for upside. |

## 📉 Execution Plan

1.  **Immediately:**
    - Buy **$2,250** of **MOH**.
    - Buy **$750** of **SYF**.
    - Buy **$750** of **SONY**.
    - Buy **$50** of **BTC**.
    - **Total Deployed:** $3,800.

2.  **Limit Orders (Set & Forget):**
    - Set Limit Buy for **SONY**: ~46 shares @ **$21.75**. (Allocating remaining $1,000).

3.  **Recurring:**
    - Set recurring buy for **BTC**: $50/week for 4 weeks. (Allocating remaining $200).

## 🛡 Risk Management
- **MOH:** Thesis relies on 2027 rate recovery. If medical costs spiral in Q1/Q2 2026, volatility will persist.
- **SONY:** Support at $21.50 is critical.
- **Buffett Insight:** His sector moves (Healthcare, Consumer Credit, Japan) validate this allocation, even if he doesn't hold these exact tickers.
