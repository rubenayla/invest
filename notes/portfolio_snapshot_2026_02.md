## ⚠️ Portfolio Health Check

### 1. Concentration Risk
*   **Top 3 Holdings (SQM, 8002, MOH):** ~48% of total portfolio.
*   **Sector Exposure:** Heavy on **Basic Materials/Commodities** (SQM, 8002, PBR, CVX, STLD). You are effectively "Long Inflation" and "Long Real Assets."

### 2. Geographic Exposure
*   **Japan:** Massive exposure via Marubeni (8002) + Sony. This is excellent (Buffett approved).
*   **Emerging Markets:** Heavy Brazil (PBR) & Chile (SQM). High political risk but high yield.

### 3. Action Items (Post-Rebalance)
*   **MOH:** Monitor the "Concentration Risk" closely. If it drops 20%, it hurts the whole portfolio.
*   **Tech Deficit:** Before adding SONY/GOOG, you were very light on Tech. The new buys balance this well.

## 📝 Change Log
*   **2026-02-07:** Added manual snapshot derived from user screenshots.
*   **2026-02-07:** Factored in new $5k deployment (MOH, SONY, SYF, BTC).
