## Executive Summary

**Thesis**: Every major Anthropic product release in Feb 2026 has triggered 8-35% single-day drops in the incumbents whose business is directly threatened. The pattern is predictable: identify the sector each new AI capability obsoletes, and position before the announcement.

**Verdict**: **ACTIONABLE — SELECTIVE SHORTS + AVOID LIST**

The "SaaSpocalypse" is real and verified. Four Anthropic launches, four sector-wide routs:

| Date | Anthropic Launch | Victims | Drop |
|------|-----------------|---------|------|
| Feb 3-4 | Cowork (AI agents manage files, tasks, workflows) | TEAM -35%, INTU -34%, $285B SaaS wipeout | 15-35% |
| Feb 5 | Agent Teams (Opus 4.6, multi-agent coordination) | IGV -30% (worst quarter since 2008) | Broad software selloff |
| Feb 20 | Claude Code Security (codebase vuln scanning) | CRWD -8%, NET -8%, OKTA -9% | 8-9% day 1, continued Mon |
| Feb 23 | COBOL Modernization Playbook | IBM -13% (worst day since 2000), -27% in Feb | 13% single day |

**The tweet predicts next targets**: Legal research, financial analysis, accounting/tax prep, IT consulting, contact centers, healthcare admin.

**Key insight**: This is not "AI hype." It's a real pattern of capability releases destroying market cap. The question is which sectors are next and which incumbents have moats vs. those that are pure "labor arbitrage" businesses.

## 1. The Pattern

Each Anthropic release follows the same script:
1. **Capability demo** shows AI doing 80-95% of what the incumbent's product does
2. **Narrative shift** — media picks up "X is dead" framing
3. **Institutional repricing** — analysts cut estimates, funds rotate out
4. **Stabilization** — some names bounce (those with real moats), others keep bleeding

The selloffs are **not always rational** (Barclays called the cybersecurity drop "incongruent"), but they are real and tradeable. Even if the fundamental threat takes years to play out, the **multiple compression happens in days**.

## 2. Verified Damage So Far (Feb 2026)

### SaaS / Productivity
- **TEAM** (Atlassian): Down ~47% YTD. Cowork directly replaces Jira/Confluence workflows for small teams.
- **INTU** (Intuit): Down ~56% from 52-week high of $814 to ~$357. TurboTax franchise under existential pressure. **Earnings Feb 26 — major catalyst.**

### Cybersecurity
- **CRWD** (CrowdStrike): -8% on Feb 20, continued selling. Claude found 500+ zero-day vulns in production open-source codebases.
- **OKTA**: -9% day 1, -6% more on Monday.
- **NET** (Cloudflare): -8% in sympathy. Less directly threatened (infrastructure vs. software security).

### Legacy IT
- **IBM**: -13% in a day (worst since 2000), -27% in February. COBOL modernization threatens their $17B consulting business. IBM pushed back: "decades of hardware-software integration cannot be replicated by moving code." Some analysts see 50%+ upside from here (oversold).

## 3. Next Targets: Sector-by-Sector Vulnerability

### Tier 1: Highest Vulnerability (Pure labor arbitrage, minimal moats)

#### IT Consulting / Outsourcing
The **clearest structural threat**. India's IT giants face "mounting contract cancellations as AI erodes the cost advantage that underpinned the country's outsourcing boom." Nifty IT index -15% in Feb.

| Ticker | Company | AI Moat | Vulnerability | Notes |
|--------|---------|---------|---------------|-------|
| INFY | Infosys | LOW | VERY HIGH | Pure labor arbitrage. Partnered with Anthropic but that doesn't save the model. |
| WIT | Wipro | LOW | VERY HIGH | Same structural risk as Infosys. |
| CTSH | Cognizant | LOW-MOD | HIGH | Slightly better mix (healthcare vertical) but still exposed. |
| ACN | Accenture | MODERATE | HIGH | Better than Indian peers — consulting/change management has value — but core dev/maintenance/testing services are automatable. |

**Catalyst**: Indian IT earnings cycle (April 2026) will show actual contract cancellation data.

#### Consumer Legal / Tax
| Ticker | Company | AI Moat | Vulnerability | Notes |
|--------|---------|---------|---------------|-------|
| LZ | LegalZoom | LOW | VERY HIGH | Consumer legal docs trivially automatable. Already -20% in a day. |
| HRB | H&R Block | LOW | HIGH | 8x P/E, 3.9% div yield — market already prices secular decline. Partnered with OpenAI. |
| INTU | Intuit | MODERATE | HIGH | TurboTax franchise under pressure. ChatGPT-class tools do tax guidance for free. **Earnings Feb 26.** |

### Tier 2: Moderate Vulnerability (Real moats being tested)

#### Financial Data / Analysis
| Ticker | Company | AI Moat | Vulnerability | Notes |
|--------|---------|---------|---------------|-------|
| FDS | FactSet | MODERATE | HIGH | Data aggregation without proprietary benchmarks = vulnerable "middle layer." |
| MORN | Morningstar | MODERATE | MOD-HIGH | Research and analysis is exactly what LLMs do well. Brand/methodology is a moat. |
| SPGI | S&P Global | STRONG | MODERATE | Credit ratings + index licensing = regulatory necessity. Capital IQ terminals at risk but not the core. |
| MSCI | MSCI | STRONG | MODERATE | Index business is sticky. Analytics layer at risk. |

**Key distinction**: Companies with **regulatory moats** (credit ratings, index licensing) are much safer than those selling **analysis and terminals**. Anthropic's Feb 24 Cowork update listed FactSet and SPGI as connector partners — bullish for platform status, still threatens terminal products.

#### Contact Centers
| Ticker | Company | AI Moat | Vulnerability | Notes |
|--------|---------|---------|---------------|-------|
| LPSN | LivePerson | LOW | VERY HIGH | $2.83/share, distressed, too small to pivot. |
| FIVN | Five9 | MODERATE | HIGH | Seat-based revenue at structural risk. New CEO, AI bookings doubled YoY. Coin-flip. |
| NICE | NICE | STRONG | MODERATE | **Anti-fragile play.** Surged 11% on earnings. AI ARR +66% YoY, 85 of Fortune 100 as customers, acquired Cognigy for $1B. At 10x FCF, could be a value buy. |

#### Professional Legal / Compliance
| Ticker | Company | AI Moat | Vulnerability | Notes |
|--------|---------|---------|---------------|-------|
| TRI | Thomson Reuters | MEDIUM | HIGH | CoCounsel is a real AI product, but Westlaw data moat is being tested. Already -16% on Anthropic legal plugin day, ~20%+ YTD decline. |
| WOLTF | Wolters Kluwer | MEDIUM | MODERATE | Diversified — only 10-13% EBIT from legal. Tax/compliance data has regulatory moats. -13% on Feb 3. |

### Tier 3: Lower Vulnerability (Strong structural moats)

#### Healthcare Admin
Regulatory barriers are the highest of any sector on this list.

| Ticker | Company | AI Moat | Vulnerability | Notes |
|--------|---------|---------|---------------|-------|
| UNH | UnitedHealth | MOD | MODERATE | Too big and too regulated to be disrupted quickly. nH Predict scandal (90% error rate) is a political risk, not an AI disruption risk. DOJ probe ongoing. |
| VEEV | Veeva Systems | STRONG | MODERATE | FDA-compliant workflows = real vertical moat. Down ~44% from highs despite genuine defensibility. Potential value if oversold. |
| EVH | Evolent Health | LOW | HIGH | $2.77/share, net loss $579M in 2025, burning cash. Speculative distressed play at best. |

## 4. Actionable Ideas

### Shorts / Puts (if you want to play the "hit list")

**Highest conviction — next Anthropic release could trigger a rout:**
1. **INFY / WIT** — Pure labor arbitrage. AI coding agents directly obsolete the model. Wait for next Anthropic developer tools release.
2. **LZ** — Consumer legal docs. Any Anthropic legal product launch = another leg down.
3. **FDS** — "Middle layer" data terminal. Most vulnerable of the financial data names.

**Moderate conviction — already beaten up but more downside possible:**
4. **INTU** — Earnings Feb 26 is make-or-break. If guidance cuts, could go to $300.
5. **ACN** — Best-in-class IT consulting, but if contract cancellations show up in April guidance, look out.

### Avoid (don't short, but don't own)
- **TEAM, CRWD, OKTA, IBM** — Already had their rout. Risk/reward for new shorts is less attractive. Some (IBM) may be oversold.

### Contrarian Longs (anti-fragile / survivors)
- **NICE** — Actually winning the AI pivot. 66% AI ARR growth. 10x FCF. Could compound.
- **SPGI / MSCI** — Regulatory moats protect the core. If Capital IQ becomes an AI platform rather than a terminal, SPGI adapts.
- **VEEV** — FDA-regulated vertical moat. If the -44% selloff is an overreaction, this is a value entry.

## 5. Key Catalysts to Watch

| Date | Event | Sectors Affected |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| Feb 26, 2026 | **Intuit earnings** | Tax prep, SaaS broadly |
| Mar 3, 2026 | **CrowdStrike earnings** | Cybersecurity — will show if Claude Code Security is actually eating pipeline |
| March 2026 | **Next Anthropic product launch** (legal? healthcare? finance?) | Whatever sector they target |
| April 2026 | **Indian IT earnings cycle** | IT consulting — actual contract cancellation data |
| Ongoing | **Anthropic product roadmap leaks or previews** | The "hit list" concept — any preview = front-running opportunity |

---

## 6. Risk to the Thesis

- **Overreaction bounces**: IBM, CRWD, and OKTA may bounce 20-30% from oversold levels. Shorting after the drop is late.
- **Implementation gap**: AI demos are impressive; production deployments take time. Enterprises move slowly.
- **Regulatory moats**: Many of these businesses (credit ratings, healthcare admin, tax compliance) exist because of regulatory complexity that AI can't eliminate.
- **Anthropic hype fatigue**: If a future launch fails to impress, the entire "hit list" narrative could reverse.
- **Incumbents adapt**: NICE is proof that some incumbents can pivot. Thomson Reuters built CoCounsel. Intuit has AI Tax Assist.

**Bottom line**: The pattern is real, the drops are verified, and the tweet's framing is broadly correct. But the easy money was in the first wave. Going forward, the alpha is in distinguishing **companies with no moat** (short candidates) from **companies whose moats are being mispriced as if they don't exist** (contrarian longs).
