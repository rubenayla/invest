# Investment Theses

Macro-level investment theses and sector/commodity analyses. Unlike individual stock watchlist items, these are thematic bets on broader trends.

## Active Theses

| Thesis | Status | Verdict | Last Updated |

| [Power](power-thesis.md) | Researched | Bullish but Entry-Selective | 2026-02-09 |

## Thesis Structure

Each thesis is a single `*-thesis.md` file in this folder. If we ever need supporting material (data, charts), prefer adding it inline unless it becomes unwieldy.

## How to Use

1. **Research phase**: Create folder, compile analysis
2. **Decision**: Document verdict and position sizing
3. **Monitoring**: Track key indicators, update as needed
4. **Exit**: Document reasoning when closing thesis

## Difference from Watchlist

| Theses | Watchlist |
|--------|-----------|
| Macro/sector bets | Individual stocks |
| Multiple instruments | Single ticker |
| Longer time horizon | Variable |
| Thematic catalyst | Company-specific |
