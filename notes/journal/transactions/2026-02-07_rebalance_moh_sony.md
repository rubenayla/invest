# Transaction Log: The "Regulatory Crisis" Rebalance & Japan Trim

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Tickers Involved:** MOH, SONY, SYF, BTC, TSLA, 8002.T
**Action:** BUY / REBALANCE / TRIM
**Capital Deployed:** $5,000 (New) + $2,800 (from Marubeni trim)

## 1. Context & Trigger
*   **Why now?** The user had $5k to deploy. Additionally, discovered that **Marubeni (8002.T)** had grown to a massive ~$7,000 position (+160% gain).
*   **Trigger:** **Molina (MOH)** crashed on "trough year" guidance. **Marubeni** showed a dangerous divergence between Momentum (GBM) and Fundamentals (DCF).
*   **User Sentiment:** User wanted to secure profits on Marubeni and diversify into Tech (SONY).

## 2. The Decision (The "Why")
### Rationale (money-first)

This trade does three things: (1) de-risks an oversized winner, (2) buys a high-conviction dislocation, and (3) sets up the next thematic sleeve without paying peak hype multiples.

*   **Molina Healthcare (MOH):** Buying the "political fear" drawdown ahead of the April rate reset catalyst. The bet is that fundamentals normalize faster than sentiment.
*   **Sony Group (SONY):** Diversify Japan exposure away from a single commodity/trading house winner into a business mix with stronger long-cycle optionality (sensors, entertainment IP, and AI-adjacent exposure).
*   **Marubeni (8002.T) - 40% trim:** Reduce concentration and lock in gains while keeping upside participation.
    *   **Model divergence (signal, not gospel):** GBM momentum showed **+164%** while DCF showed **-75%**. That is "crowded winner + valuation caution," so trimming is risk management, not a bearish thesis.

### Macro overlay: Power bottleneck ("energy production shortage") and how it gets priced (2026-2030)

The investable shortage is not annual MWh. It is **deliverable firm power** and **grid throughput**:

*   **Time-to-power** becomes the gating item: interconnection and transmission timelines decide which projects can energize sites.
*   Tightness shows up as **capacity value, congestion/basis, and volatility/ancillary pricing**, not as a simple "there isn't enough generation" headline.
*   The profit pool concentrates in (1) **regulated wires** (capex into rate base), (2) **grid equipment/EPC** (backlog + pricing), and (3) **existing firm generation** near load (PPAs and scarcity).

**What this means for us**: we should treat power as a **separate sleeve** with staged entries. Some "obvious winners" can still make money, but only if you don't overpay for the story.

### Optional Add-On: Power Bottleneck Sleeve (Proposal, Not Executed Here)

If you want to add explicit exposure now (instead of waiting), the current money-first picks from the power thesis are **EXC** (regulated “wires”) and **NRG** (merchant power with better valuation support than the premium basket).

**Staged entries (DB 2026-02-07 prices):**
| Ticker | Role | Price | Entry (-10%) | Entry (-20%) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | :--- |
| **EXC** | Wires / rate base | 44.33 | 39.90 | 35.46 | More durable, less hype. |
| **NRG** | Merchant scarcity | 153.32 | 137.99 | 122.66 | More upside torque, more policy risk. |

**Sizing rule**: start small (ex: 5-10% of incremental cash) and scale in only if the thesis persists and execution is clean.

**If you want more names (not a recommendation to buy all of them):**
- **Premium-priced torque**: **CEG / VST** (firm/merchant generation), and **ETN / PWR / GEV** (grid build picks-and-shovels). These can work, but entries matter because multiples can compress quickly.
- **Higher-risk regulated**: **AES / EIX / PCG** (rate base angle with leverage/jurisdiction risk). Treat as position sizing names, not default core holdings.

## 3. Execution Details
| Ticker | Action | Amount ($) | Allocation | Price Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **8002.T** | **SELL (TRIM)** | **~$2,800** | **-40%** | **Market.** Lock in 160% gains. |
| **MOH** | BUY | **$2,250** | 45% | **Market.** Catch the regulatory dip. |
| **SONY** | BUY | **$750** | 15% | **Market.** Lock exposure. |
| **SONY** | BUY LIMIT | **$1,000** | 20% | **Limit @ $21.75.** Tech support level. |
| **SYF** | BUY | **$750** | 15% | **Market.** Cash flow hedge. |
| **BTC** | BUY | **$250** | 5% | **DCA.** $50/week for 5 weeks. |
| **TSLA** | HOLD | -- | -- | Retain $3k position. |

## 4. Risk & Exit Plan
*   **MOH:** Watch April Final Rate Announcement. Support ~$110.
*   **8002.T:** The remaining ~$4,200 is now "House Money." Zero stress.
*   **SONY:** If breaks below $20.00, thesis is broken.
