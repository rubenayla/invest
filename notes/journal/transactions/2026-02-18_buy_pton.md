# Investment Transaction Log

**Date:** 2026-02-18
**Tickers Involved:** [PTON]
**Action:** BUY LIMIT

## 1. Context & Trigger
*   **Why now?** Stock down 28% post Q2 FY2026 earnings miss (Feb 5). Sitting near 52-week low ($4.09). Revenue missed but EBITDA beat and FCF guidance raised.
*   **Market Conditions:** Post-earnings washout. 20% short interest. Analyst targets being cut ($9.30 median, down from higher).

## 2. The Decision (The "Why")
*   **Thesis Update:** At-home fitness decline is COVID demand normalization, not structural market death. Pre-COVID trendline puts PTON revenue at ~$2.5B — roughly where they are now. Rate of decline decelerating (-12.5% to -9.2%). Revenue should stabilize near current levels.
*   **Valuation Logic:** 4.5x fwd EV/EBITDA vs 10.4x sector median. 15.3% FCF yield. If revenue stabilizes and multiple re-rates to 6-8x, stock doubles.
*   **Contrarian Angle:** Market pricing in permanent decline. If it's just a COVID hangover bottoming out, the valuation is absurdly cheap for a business generating $275M+ FCF.

## 4. Risk & Exit Plan
*   **Invalidation Point:** Below $2.50 — reassess (market pricing turnaround failure). Also if churn accelerates above 2.5% monthly or revenue declines >8% in Q3.
*   **Target:** $8-10 range (6-8x EV/EBITDA on $475-500M EBITDA). Re-evaluate after May/June 2026 term loan refi catalyst.
*   **Second tranche:** Consider adding at $3.50-3.80 if support breaks.
