# Summary (Main updates, then in detail below)
## Wallet
- **MOH** (Molina Healthcare)
  - Giant crash like CNC, but they have a better balance sheet and are more efficient.
  - Their Medical Cost Ratio went from 88% to 90%, but it was already expected. The sudden fall seems quite irrational, since it affected CNC not MOH. "wait, if Centene got hit, maybe all Medicaid/ACA insurers are riskier than we thought".
- **TSLA**
- **SQM**
    - Low costs of lithium production, so one of the few that can survive long-term while benefiting from high lithium prices if they grow
- **BRK.B**
- **STLD**
- **CVX**
- **8002** (Marubeni Corp.)
