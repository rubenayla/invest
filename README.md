# TODO
- 
- Update checklists to use check operating margin instead of gross
- Check these stocks: BIDU, CSCO, IBM, META, ORCL, PYPL, QCOM, SAP
- Study LOGI in more depth. Great fundamentals. I would pay twice its stock value
- Study skyworks in more depth
- Study steel dynamics. What's going to happen with steel demand? If it falls back down after all these investments, the stock will collapse.
