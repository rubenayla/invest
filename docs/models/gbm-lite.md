# GBM Lite Models

Ultra-lightweight gradient boosting models optimized for maximum stock coverage with minimal data requirements.

## Overview

GBM Lite models use machine learning to rank stocks by expected returns while requiring only **2 quarters of historical data** - enabling predictions for ~98% of stocks in the database.

## Key Features

- **Minimal Data Requirements**: Only 2 quarters needed (vs 8+ for full GBM)
- **Maximum Coverage**: Works for 589/598 stocks (98.5%)
- **Strong Performance**: Rank IC 0.50 (1y) and 0.40 (3y)
- **Efficient**: 59 features (vs 464 for full GBM)

## Available Variants

### GBM Lite 1y
Predicts 1-year forward returns.

- **Rank IC**: 0.50
- **Decile Spread**: 66%
- **Coverage**: 589 stocks

### GBM Lite 3y
Predicts 3-year forward returns.

- **Rank IC**: 0.40
- **Decile Spread**: 145%
- **Coverage**: 589 stocks

## How It Works

### 1. Feature Engineering

The model uses 59 engineered features derived from:

**Current Snapshot (27 base features)**:
- Profitability: profit_margins, operating_margins, gross_margins, ROE, ROA
- Growth: revenue_growth, earnings_growth
- Balance Sheet: debt_to_equity, current_ratio, quick_ratio
- Valuation: PE, PB, PS, EV/EBITDA, EV/Revenue
- Dividends: dividend_yield, payout_ratio
- Company: market_cap, beta
- Market: VIX, 10Y Treasury
- Price Momentum: returns_1m, returns_3m, returns_6m, returns_1y, volatility, volume_trend

**Engineered Features** (2.2x per base feature):
- Computed yields: FCF yield, OCF yield, earnings yield
- Log transforms: log(market_cap)
- **QoQ changes**: Quarter-over-quarter deltas
- Missingness flags: Binary indicators for missing data
- Categorical: Sector encoding

### 2. What's Excluded (vs Full GBM)

To achieve 2-quarter minimum, we removed:

- ❌ **Lag features** (would require 3+ quarters)
- ❌ **Rolling windows** (would require 4-6+ quarters)
- ❌ **YoY changes** (would require 5 quarters)

### 3. Training Process

```python
# Cross-sectional normalization
features_normalized = winsorize(features, 1st-99th percentile)
features_normalized = standardize(features, by_date=True)

# LightGBM ranking objective
model = lgb.train(
    params={'objective': 'regression', 'metric': 'rmse'},
    train_data=train_set,
    num_boost_round=500,
    early_stopping_rounds=50
)
```

### 4. Prediction Output

For each stock, the model provides:

- **Expected Return**: Predicted percentage return over horizon
- **Percentile Rank**: 0-100 ranking vs all stocks
- **Decile**: 1-10 grouping (10 = top 10% expected returns)

## Performance Metrics

### Rank Information Coefficient (IC)

Measures correlation between predicted ranks and actual returns:

- **GBM Lite 1y**: 0.50 (strong predictive power)
- **GBM Lite 3y**: 0.40 (good long-term signal)

### Decile Spread

Average return difference between top and bottom deciles:

- **GBM Lite 1y**: 66% (top 10% outperform bottom 10% by 66%)
- **GBM Lite 3y**: 145% (massive 3-year spread)

### Comparison to Full GBM

| Metric | GBM Lite 1y | GBM Full 1y | Delta |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Rank IC | 0.50 | 0.59 | -15% |
| Decile Spread | 66% | 75% | -12% |
| Features | 59 | 464 | -87% |
| Coverage | 589 stocks | 589 stocks | Same |
| Min Quarters | 2 | 8 | -75% |

**Key Insight**: GBM Lite achieves 85-88% of full GBM's performance while covering the same stocks with 76% fewer features.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Cross-Sectional Learning

GBM models learn **relative** patterns, not absolute values:

1. **Z-score normalization per date**: All features standardized within each time period
2. **Ranking objective**: Model predicts relative ordering, not exact returns
3. **Regime-agnostic**: Works across market conditions by focusing on cross-sectional relationships

### Why It Works with Minimal History

**Current snapshot + momentum captures most signal**:
- Fundamental quality metrics (profitability, growth, leverage)
- Valuation multiples (relative cheapness)
- Recent price momentum (trend signals)
- QoQ changes (acceleration/deceleration)

**What historical depth adds** (full GBM):
- Mean reversion patterns (rolling averages)
- Volatility trends (rolling std)
- Long-term momentum (lags, slopes)

For stock ranking, current state + recent changes provide most discriminating power.

## Use Cases

### Best For

- **New listings**: Stocks with limited trading history
- **Broad coverage**: When you need predictions for almost all stocks
- **Resource efficiency**: Fast training and prediction
- **Baseline model**: Good starting point before adding complexity

### Not Ideal For

- **Absolute return forecasts**: Use LSTM models instead
- **Maximum accuracy**: Use full GBM if you have 8+ quarters
- **Market timing**: Use Opportunistic GBM instead

## Implementation Example

```python
from invest.scripts.run_gbm_predictions import run_predictions

# Run GBM Lite 1y predictions
predictions = run_predictions(
    variant='lite',
    horizon='1y',
    db_path='data/stock_data.db'
)

# Get top decile stocks
top_stocks = predictions[predictions['decile'] >= 9]
print(f"Top 20% stocks: {len(top_stocks)}")
```
