# AI Tools Integration

The Investment Analysis Framework is designed to be **AI-controlled**. AI models like Claude and Gemini execute the entire research process autonomously using specialized tools.

## ü§ñ Core Concept: AI Controls Everything

**Key Point**: The AI model (not the human) runs the analysis, interprets results, and performs research using the available tools.

- **Human Role**: Configure investment criteria in YAML files
- **AI Role**: Execute systematic screening, analyze results, perform deep-dive research, and generate recommendations

## Available AI Tool Categories

The framework provides three categories of tools that AI models can use:

### 1. üîç Systematic Screening Tools

**Location**: `src/invest/ai_tools/*/screening_tools.py`

AI models use these tools to:
- Execute systematic analysis pipelines on large stock universes
- Filter stocks based on quality, value, growth, and risk criteria
- Generate screening reports with pass/fail indicators
- Rank stocks by composite scores

**Example AI Workflow**:
```python
# AI model executes this automatically
run_screening_analysis(config="sp500_full.yaml", save_csv=True)
# Results: AI identifies 25-50 companies that pass all filters
```

### 2. üìä Research and Analysis Tools  

**Location**: `src/invest/ai_tools/*/research_tools.py`

AI models use these tools to:
- Perform deep-dive analysis on companies that pass screening
- Gather additional financial data and metrics
- Analyze business models and competitive positioning
- Generate qualitative insights and research reports

**Example AI Workflow**:
```python
# AI model automatically researches promising candidates
analyze_company_fundamentals(ticker="GOOGL")
research_competitive_landscape(sector="Technology")  
generate_investment_thesis(company="Google")
```

### 3. üíº Portfolio Construction Tools

**Location**: `src/invest/ai_tools/*/portfolio_tools.py`

AI models use these tools to:
- Build diversified portfolios from screened stocks
- Optimize position sizing and sector allocation
- Generate portfolio recommendations and reports
- Track portfolio performance and risk metrics

**Example AI Workflow**:
```python
# AI model constructs optimized portfolios
build_portfolio(filtered_stocks, target_size=20)
optimize_sector_allocation(portfolio, max_sector_weight=0.25)
generate_portfolio_report(portfolio)
```

## AI Integration Platforms

The framework integrates with two major AI platforms:

### Claude Desktop Integration

**Directory**: `src/invest/ai_tools/claude/`

**Available Tools**:
- `screening_tools.py` - Systematic analysis execution
- `research_tools.py` - Company research and analysis  
- `portfolio_tools.py` - Portfolio construction and optimization
- `data_tools.py` - Data gathering and processing

**AI Usage**: Claude models can directly access these tools through the Claude Desktop interface.

### Gemini AI Integration

**Directory**: `src/invest/ai_tools/gemini/`

**Available Tools**:
- `screening_tools.py` - Systematic analysis execution
- `research_tools.py` - Company research and analysis
- `portfolio_tools.py` - Portfolio construction and optimization  
- `data_tools.py` - Data gathering and processing

**AI Usage**: Gemini models can access these tools through the Gemini AI platform.

## Complete AI-Controlled Workflow

Here's how an AI model would typically use this framework:

### Step 1: AI Runs Systematic Screening

```bash
# AI model executes systematic analysis
uv run python scripts/systematic_analysis.py configs/sp500_top100.yaml --save-csv

# AI automatically:
# - Fetches S&P 500 stock data
# - Applies quality, value, growth, risk filters
# - Generates screening results with pass/fail indicators
# - Identifies 20-40 companies that meet all criteria
```

### Step 2: AI Analyzes Screening Results

```python
# AI model automatically:
# 1. Reads the generated CSV file
# 2. Identifies stocks that passed all filters (Passes_Filters = Y)
# 3. Ranks them by composite score
# 4. Selects top candidates for deep-dive analysis
```

### Step 3: AI Performs Deep Research

For each promising candidate, the AI model:
- Uses research tools to gather additional data
- Analyzes business model and competitive position
- Evaluates management quality and strategy
- Assesses industry trends and growth prospects
- Generates investment thesis for each company

### Step 4: AI Constructs Portfolio

Finally, the AI model:
- Uses portfolio tools to build diversified portfolios
- Optimizes sector allocation and position sizing
- Considers correlation and risk factors
- Generates final investment recommendations

## Key Advantages of AI Control
