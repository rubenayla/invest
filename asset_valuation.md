> The value of an asset is the present value of its future cash flows, discounted at the required rate of return.

- financing cost = weighted average of cost of equity and cost of debt
    - Cost of equity = risk-free rate + beta * (market return - risk-free rate)
        - Risk-free rate = yield on 10-year government bonds
    - Cost of debt = (Risk-free rate + default spread) * (1 - tax rate)
- Future cash flows
    - Calculate the current ones: Net income (consider the operating one)
    - Free cash flow = after tax operating income * (1 - reinvestment rate)
    > what happens when the company reinvests all its cash flows? It's not giving net income but its intrinsic value is increasing
    Affected by the growth, which increases with reinvestmente rate, and by the % of cash flow that can be extracted, which decreases with reinvestment rate
Terminal value in year n = free cash flow in year (n+1) / (discount rate - perpetual growth rate)
