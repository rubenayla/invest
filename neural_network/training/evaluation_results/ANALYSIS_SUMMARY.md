# Neural Network Model Evaluation - Comprehensive Analysis

**Model**: `best_model.pt` (LSTM/Transformer hybrid)
**Target Horizon**: 1-year forward returns
**Test Period**: 2021-01-05 to 2022-11-30
**Evaluation Date**: 2025-10-09

---

## Executive Summary

The neural network model shows **poor generalization** to the test period (2021-2022). While the architecture is sophisticated (LSTM + Transformer + MC Dropout), the model fails to predict returns accurately outside its training distribution.

### Key Metrics
- **MAE**: 28.73% (predictions off by ~29 percentage points)
- **RMSE**: 46.74%
- **R¬≤**: -0.5187 (worse than predicting the mean)
- **Correlation**: -0.2122 (weak negative correlation!)
- **Hit Rate**: 53.47% (barely better than coin flip)
- **95% CI Coverage**: 79.21% (confidence intervals too narrow)

**Verdict**: ‚ùå **Model is NOT production-ready**

## Problem Analysis

### 1. **Distribution Shift**

The test period (2021-2022) represents a completely different market regime than the training data (2006-2020):

- **Training period**: Pre-COVID, "normal" market conditions
  - Average 1-year return: ~17.7%
  - Relatively stable patterns

- **Test period**: COVID recovery + market downturn
  - Extreme volatility
  - Many stocks with 50-200% returns (e.g., NVDA +205%, META +203%)
  - Model predicts -20% to +10%, reality is -50% to +200%

### 2. **Massive Prediction Errors**

**Worst 10 Predictions:**
| Stock | Sector | Predicted | Actual | Error |
|-------|--------|-----------|--------|-------|
| NVDA | Technology | -6.62% | +205.10% | **-211.72%** |
| META | Communication Services | -3.19% | +203.51% | **-206.70%** |
| NFLX | Communication Services | -0.43% | +158.17% | **-158.60%** |
| GE | Industrials | -3.28% | +127.07% | **-130.36%** |
| ISRG | Healthcare | -18.18% | +71.66% | **-89.84%** |

The model completely missed the tech stock recovery in late 2022.

### 3. **Sector-Specific Failures**

**Best Sectors** (still poor):
- Utilities: MAE = 4.96%
- Real Estate: MAE = 8.21%
- Consumer Defensive: MAE = 11.66%
- Financial Services: MAE = 14.39%

**Worst Sectors**:
- Communication Services: MAE = **71.45%** ‚ùå
- Technology: MAE = **44.48%** ‚ùå
- Energy: MAE = **41.19%** ‚ùå
- Consumer Cyclical: MAE = 31.41%

The model fails catastrophically on growth/tech stocks with high volatility.

### 4. **Confidence Calibration Issues**

- **95% CI Coverage**: 79.21% (should be ~95%)
- Confidence intervals are too narrow ‚Üí overconfident predictions
- MC Dropout (100 samples) is not capturing true uncertainty

---

## Root Causes

### 1. **Overfitting to Training Distribution**
- Model learned patterns specific to 2006-2020 market conditions
- Cannot generalize to COVID-era volatility
- No exposure to 100%+ annual returns during training

### 2. **Feature Limitations**
- Uses only fundamental metrics (PE, margins, growth, etc.)
- Missing macro indicators that drive 2021-2022 volatility:
  - Interest rates (near-zero ‚Üí rising)
  - Fed policy shifts
  - Pandemic recovery dynamics
  - Supply chain disruptions

### 3. **Limited Training Data**
- Only 3,367 snapshots from 103 stocks
- Spans 2006-2022 but most data pre-COVID
- Insufficient examples of extreme market regimes

### 4. **Test Set Bias**
- Test period (2021-2022) is NOT representative of future markets
- Includes once-in-a-decade COVID recovery
- May not be fair evaluation of "normal" conditions

## Detailed Findings

### Decade-by-Decade Performance

| Decade | MAE | RMSE | Correlation | Hit Rate | Samples |
|--------|-----|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| 2020s (2021-2022) | 28.73% | 46.74% | -0.21 | 53.47% | 101 |

*Note: Only one decade in test set due to limited data range*

### Sector Performance (sorted by MAE)

| Rank | Sector | MAE | Correlation | Hit Rate | Samples |
|------|--------|-----|-------------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Utilities | 4.96% | 0.421 | 66.67% | 3 |
| 2 | Real Estate | 8.21% | nan | 0.00% | 1 |
| 3 | Consumer Defensive | 11.66% | 0.408 | 62.50% | 8 |
| 4 | Financial Services | 14.39% | 0.267 | 77.78% | 18 |
| 5 | Healthcare | 19.89% | -0.378 | 61.90% | 21 |
| 6 | Industrials | 31.27% | -0.273 | 76.92% | 13 |
| 7 | Consumer Cyclical | 31.41% | -0.730 | 28.57% | 7 |
| 8 | Basic Materials | 40.41% | nan | 0.00% | 1 |
| 9 | Energy | 41.19% | -0.602 | 33.33% | 3 |
| 10 | Technology | 44.48% | -0.182 | 30.00% | 20 |
| 11 | Communication Services | 71.45% | -0.185 | 16.67% | 6 |

**Insights**:
- Model works "okay" on stable sectors (Utilities, Consumer Defensive, Financials)
- Fails on volatile growth sectors (Tech, Communications, Energy)
- Negative correlations in worst sectors suggest model is anti-predictive

### Confidence Estimation Quality

**95% Confidence Interval Coverage**: 79.21%
- Should be ~95% if model is well-calibrated
- Too narrow ‚Üí model is overconfident
- MC Dropout with 100 samples insufficient

**Standard Deviation Analysis**:
- Average prediction std: ~0.19 (19%)
- But actual errors: ~0.29 (29%)
- Model underestimates uncertainty by ~50%

## Recommendations

### üö® Immediate Actions

1. **DO NOT use this model in production**
   - Predictions are unreliable (MAE 29%)
   - May lead to poor investment decisions
   - Confidence intervals are misleading

2. **Re-evaluate test strategy**
   - 2021-2022 may not be representative test period
   - Consider walk-forward validation on multiple time periods
   - Test on 2015-2017, 2018-2019, 2023-2024 separately

3. **Inspect training data quality**
   - Verify forward returns calculations
   - Check for data leakage
   - Ensure train/val/test splits are proper

### üîß Model Improvements

#### Short-term (Incremental Fixes)

1. **Add macro features**
   - Interest rates (10-year treasury)
   - VIX (volatility index)
   - Fed policy indicators
   - Sector rotation indicators

2. **Improve confidence calibration**
   - Increase MC Dropout samples (100 ‚Üí 500+)
   - Try other uncertainty methods:
     - Ensemble models (train 5-10 models)
     - Conformal prediction
     - Bayesian neural networks

3. **Sector-specific models**
   - Train separate models for stable vs volatile sectors
   - Tech/Growth model vs Utilities/Defensive model

4. **Add regime detection**
   - Detect market regime (bull/bear/volatile)
   - Adjust predictions based on current regime

#### Long-term (Architectural Changes)

1. **Multi-task learning**
   - Predict multiple horizons (1m, 3m, 6m, 1y, 2y) jointly
   - Share representations across tasks
   - Improve generalization

2. **Attention mechanisms**
   - Add sector/stock-specific attention
   - Learn which features matter for each stock
   - Interpretability++

3. **Transfer learning**
   - Pre-train on large dataset (all stocks, all time periods)
   - Fine-tune on specific sectors or time periods

4. **Hybrid approach**
   - Combine NN predictions with traditional models (DCF, RIM)
   - NN predicts residuals after traditional models
   - Ensemble for robustness

### üìä Data Strategy

1. **Expand training data**
   - Include more stocks (435 current stocks ‚Üí all S&P 500)
   - More frequent snapshots (quarterly ‚Üí monthly)
   - Longer history (2006-2020 ‚Üí 1990-2020)

2. **Data augmentation**
   - Synthetic samples from similar stocks
   - Time series augmentation (jittering, warping)
   - Cross-sectional augmentation

3. **Better test sets**
   - Out-of-time validation (2023-2024)
   - Out-of-sector validation (train on Tech, test on Energy)
   - Stress testing (2008 financial crisis, 2020 COVID)

## Comparison with Traditional Models

**Question to investigate**: How do traditional models (DCF, RIM, Simple Ratios) perform on the same test set?

If traditional models have similar MAE (~20-30%), then the problem is:
- **Fundamental unpredictability** of 2021-2022 period
- No model can predict COVID recovery + Fed pivot

If traditional models have much better MAE (<15%), then:
- **Neural network is flawed**
- Traditional models capture essential patterns better
- NN is overfitting or missing key signals

**Next step**: Run evaluation comparing:
- Neural Network (MAE: 28.73%)
- DCF Model (MAE: ?)
- RIM Model (MAE: ?)
- Simple Ratios (MAE: ?)
- Ensemble (MAE: ?)

## Conclusion

The current neural network model **fails to generalize** to the 2021-2022 test period, with MAE of 28.73% and negative R¬≤. The model is **not ready for production use**.

**Primary issue**: Distribution shift between training (2006-2020) and test (2021-2022) periods. The COVID recovery and subsequent market volatility are not represented in training data.

**Path forward**:
1. Evaluate traditional models for comparison
2. Add macro features and retrain
3. Implement better uncertainty quantification
4. Test on multiple time periods to ensure robustness

**Key lesson**: Even sophisticated architectures (LSTM + Transformer) cannot overcome fundamental data distribution shifts. Model must be trained on diverse market regimes or include regime-aware features.
