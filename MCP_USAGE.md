## üîß Advanced Features

### Model Selection
The MCP server automatically selects appropriate models based on:
- Company characteristics (size, sector, financial health)
- Data availability and quality
- Model suitability criteria

### Caching Strategy
- Uses 4-hour cache for stock data
- Balances performance with data freshness
- Automatic cache invalidation for stale data

### Error Handling  
- Graceful degradation when models fail
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Fallback to alternative models when possible

### Performance Optimization
- Async processing for bulk operations
- Intelligent batching for screening operations  
- Configurable timeouts and limits

## üö® Important Notes

### Data Sources
- Uses yfinance for real-time stock data
- Leverages cached fundamental data when available
- Neural networks require trained model files

### Model Availability
- Some models may not be suitable for all stocks
- Neural network models require sufficient training data
- Sector-specific models auto-select based on company classification

### Rate Limiting
- Respects API rate limits for data providers
- Implements backoff strategies for bulk operations
- Caches data to minimize external calls

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Model not suitable for this stock"**
   - Some models require specific financial data
   - Try using `simple_ratios` as a fallback
   - Check if the company has sufficient historical data

2. **"Neural network prediction failed"**  
   - Ensure neural network model files are present
   - Check if the stock has sufficient fundamental data
   - Try using a different timeframe

3. **"No stocks found matching criteria"**
   - Relax screening criteria (higher P/E, lower ROE)
   - Try a different stock universe
   - Increase the limit parameter

### Debug Mode
Set environment variable for detailed logging:
```bash
export INVESTMENT_MCP_DEBUG=1
poetry run python mcp_server_v2.py
```

## üìä Model Performance

### Neural Network Models
- **2-Year Model**: 51.8% correlation, 100% hit rate (BEST)
- **3-Month Model**: 25.0% correlation, 50% hit rate  
- **1-Year Model**: 1.1% correlation, 100% hit rate

### Traditional Models
- **DCF Models**: Best for cash flow positive companies
- **RIM Model**: Excellent for financial companies
- **Market Ratios**: Fast screening and cross-validation
